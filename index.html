    <span>I find it ironic that in the pledge of allegiance we end it by saying "with liberty and justice for all" while he have committed such an injustice and built our nation upon it. 
    When I heard that only 4% of the earths population (us) has contributed such a vast amount of carbon emissions while the poorest 3 billion have contributed only 5% I was disgusted. How can we claim to provide justice for "all" while we only benefit ourselves in our carbon rich lifestyle. 
    Those who have not enjoyed the way of life that we have, and who have not produced the carbon footprint that we have, are going to feel the worst part of our consequences. </span></div>
    &nbsp;
    <div><span dir="auto">I found it interesting that you mentions cigarette smoking in this video. While it was used in a great analogy, it also made me think about how not too long ago smoking was very very popular. 
    Virtually everyone smoked until the negative consequences were widely publicized and packages were labeled to warn of the carcinogens in cigarettes. I feel like the climate crisis will continue to get worse until it's consequences are widely publicized. 
    Could you imagine if gas stations had labels on their pumps that read "Warning: This product produces harmful gases that can lead to the death of our planet"? I feel that people will not understand the danger until it is staring them right in the face. I agree with Ken's commentary on the delayed responses of our people.

    <div><span>I agree with what you said. It really has become evident throughout history that the poorest and most marginalized groups will always be forced to bear the consequences of the rich and most privileged mistakes. Just like you pointed out, the irony of our self-proclaimed “hero” of the world and justice is that we are also the villains. The US, along with other developed countries, has been proven to be the most destructive and selfish nation. Rarely do these countries actually aim to help these underdeveloped nations without an alternative reason. It is also clear that the majority of humans are just victims of our atrocities and will continue to be so long as we continue on this unsustainable path. 
    </span></div>

    <div><span>I think eventually there will be warning signs like you said, but I think it might be too late by then. So many people continue to be in denial and especially the politicians who are supposed to be running this country. I would argue that even if we were to broadcast the effects of pollution to everyone, it would not be enough. A lot of people simply do not care to change their habits or think it to be impossible. As Ken said, we have not educated the population on how to live sustainably to the point where some can’t even imagine a life that doesn’t in some way harm the earth. If we continue on with the cigarette analogy, there have been fewer users but there has also been a rise in vaping and other similar products. These new products are just as bad or worse yet more people use them every day. 
    It seems that even if everyone were to stop living the way they do now, that a new way to pollute the world will emerge to wreak more damage. Major business corporations always find a way to exploit and harm others so I am certain that even if the use of fossil fuels were to decrease, that they would find something 10x worse. Perhaps I am simply pessimistic, but I think it will take a more radical approach to actually change things.</span>

    <div><span>The United States is seen as an incredibly influential nation. In the past several decades the united states has not been a positive role model for the rest of the world. Outputting absurd amounts of carbon dioxide for its population has been a bad example for the up and coming nations. How are we going to combat this issue and help others lower CO2 output when we as the strongest nation in the world with the largest economy still are unable to lower our CO2. Our carelessness will affect every upcoming nation and will ruin the lives of billions if we keep continuing on this path.

      Each video that Professor Hiltner shows us is shocking as there is so much on this topic that I do not know about. In a single generation we completely changed the world climate and its effects are drastically affecting the world and its inhabitants. Things must change quickly or we will not be able to save this planet</span>

    <span>I agree with everything you said and like the interesting perspective that you paralled climate change with the pledge of allegiance. I think this statment helps to give another perspective on what we as humans are doing to our planet, and the effects they have. I also was disgusted with how much the developed countries have contributed to climate change and how little developing countries are contributing. This makes me feel sick because over half of the entire popoulation is and will be having to deal with our mistakes. I hope that the younger generation is able to put a hault to climate change in hopes for our planet and for each one of our individual futures. 
    <br><br>
    Your example that you offered about gasoline is also a very crucial point to make when discussing the climate crisis and the effects that individuals actions have on the planet. The climate crisis is seen as a collective fault, but the gas and cigarette example helps to show that peoples individual actions have effects to our planet. Both lectures shared an interesting perspective to me on the generational aspect to the climate crisis and how it has fallen into our hands to take action. We need to be more proactive in educating others and taking direct action. I agree with you and Kens ideas on how the delayed responses to climate change have affected our planet even more.

    <span>Thank you for sharing your viewpoint and I completely agree with you! The disproportionate amount of carbon dioxide emission from the developed countries concerning their population in the world is truly shocking and unfair especially to underdeveloped countries. It makes me wonder about how those countries, despite the small population percentages they occupy in the world, can contribute such a large proportion of the total carbon dioxide emission worldwide and consume an equally enormous proportion of natural resources in the world. Based on my experience living in the U.S., I think that a major factor in this situation and a possible answer to this question is the habit of wasting resources. The developed countries, particularly the U.S. all seem to have a notorious reputation of wasteful habits: we waste food, water, papers, fossil fuels, and many many more types of natural resources. 
    <br><br>
    Your comment also reminds me of an article on the ecological footprints of the countries in the world in which the U.S. and several other European countries are ranked very high up at the top positions, which again indicates how wasteful the developed countries are as they unnecessarily consume an excessive amount of resources and leave large ecological footprints on our environment. Therefore, to solve and alleviate the issue of climate change, the developed countries should take charge and take the initiative to implement environmentally-friendly policies and regulations to help save our planets because they can be said as the leading culprits for causing climate change and the deterioration of our environment.

    I completely agree with you. The visual and statistical description of carbon emissions per country is frustrating. It brings to light the consequence of privilege as well as the inclination to live ignorantly ignoring repercussions unless immediately and directly affected. How can we be proud of being a leading power in the world if we are also the leading destroyer? I agree it is so unjust to continue this way of life ignoring the fact that the planet is not ours alone and people who are undeserving will suffer from the rich's actions. I personally am really interested in the generational gap in caring or believing in the climate crisis. I think it is always important to remember to not shame but educate and respecting that it is each person's decision on how to live even though it may be frustrating. I too thought the smoking analogy was perfect especially since smoking companies hired scientists to prove smoking is not bad for you. I think there is a huge parallel between the two situations and it was a simple and impactful way of explaining. Ken does an amazing job of articulating with purpose rather than emotion as well as explaining in an understandable way.  I think this video calls for action, reflection, and conversation.

    I really like how you've brought in the constitution as a political connection to the issue. This is important to talk about because, yes the problem lies in our hands, but our government plays a huge role in facilitating a solution. Pulling out of things like the Paris Agreement does not make the US look like they are serious about resolving climate change. This is very unfair of our nation, as we are a chief contributor to the problem. We must vote and act as a democracy to get the change we need.

    I loved your comment! I loved your analogy of the pledge of allegiance showing just how hypocritical our country can be. The U.S tends to think of ourselves as a role model to other countries but our refusal to take a stand and pledge to start using renewables goes to show how behind we are. Our country was built on the foundations of fossil fuels and that can point to why our economy is so ahead other developing countries like India for example. We should be demonstrating that renewables are the way the to a successful and stable economy.  We have a history of building upon the poorest and defenseless but the fact that only 4% of the world's population is responsible for the majority of the carbon in the atmosphere, goes to show the injustice that goes along with climate change. But what I am most frightened about is that climate change occurred in one single lifetime. The fact that one lifetime will be responsible for millions of potential catastrophes is insane. Our world has gone billions of years and through millions of people but one group is most responsible for putting the majority of the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Since they are not being held accountable, the younger generations and ones to come will have to deal with their mistakes.

    Respectfully, I take issue with your claim that the environmental policy and our use of carbon-based energy of the U.S. is inconsistent with the last phrase of the Pledge of Allegiance. It is hard to argue that the United State's energy consumption has only benefited the U.S. and has had disproportionally negative effects for those in developing nations. In actuality, the economic success of the U.S., which I agree is in large part due to energy consumption, has had a profoundly positive effect on developing nations and has helped to spread prosperity across the world. However, I agree with you that the United States needs to continue to be at the forefront of combatting climate change and preparing to mitigate the potential consequences, especially in less developed countries that are more vulnerable to the catastrophic effects of climate change.
Additionally, I believe it is misguided to impugn the United States by claiming the country is uniquely responsible for anthropogenic climate change. While I agree with you that the U.S. and other developed nations have historically produced an inordinately disproportionate amount of greenhosue gases, the U.S. has been at the forefront of combating climate change by leading the world in reducing greenhouse gases. Additionally, the United States is not the largest per capita emitter and even since leaving the Paris Agreement our emissions have continued to fall. The same is not true of other countries such as China and India, who have continued to increase emissions. 
The lecture itself is very interesting and raises the issue of how to make people understand the problems posed by climate change and the potential consequences. I think other commenters are correct when they say people are not going to take action until they can understand or experience the real effects of climate change. I think approaches such as the one taken by David Wallace-Wells in the reading for this week are effective in scaring people into confronting the problem. Nevertheless, it will take continued education and activism to garner enough public understanding of the issue and support for meaningful action.

    I totally agree with what you said. The united states has been a nation built on hypocrisy and injustice, so it is no surprise that they are doing an injustice to the entire planet. As one of, if not the biggest world power, you would think or hope that they would do something positive with their tremendous amount of influence and strive to alleviate the climate crisis by reducing the poisonous footprint that they are leaving of the face of the earth. Of course, you and i are both people of this nation who reap the benefits of this 'carbon-rich lifestyle' in comparison to our less fortunate contemporaries across the globe, but it is up to the leaders of the nation who control the way we live in such luxury to begin thinking about the future that the following generations will have to suffer through if nothing is done. Just like the people who smoked cigarettes until they came to realize the cancer it causes, in the same way the united states will keep diminishing resources until we plague ourselves with an irreversible environmental disease.

    I agree with your assertion that the United States' energy consumption has had a positive effect on developing nation and as has as well spread prosperity throughout the world. The United States' energy consumption has made a lot of scientific advances possible, and moreover, the science demonstrating that we are causing irreparable harm to our environment is somewhat recent. However, it is also critical that we realize now that our actions are setting us on a course of environmental degradation, and mass extinction. As we learned in lecture, 97% of Terrestrial Animal Mass (Excluding Insects) is made up of humans and their cattle. By reducing consumption of animal products, we can limit our carbon emission as well as mitigate other issues that livestock bring (i.e soil degradation that could lead to another Dust Bowl). As one of the most influential (if not the most) influential country in the world, it is our duty to be at the forefront of combating climate change.


While I agree with your assertions in the first paragraph, I disagree with some claims you make in the second one. The U.S is not solely responsible for anthropogenic climate change, but it is the biggest contributor per capita towards it. China is a larger contributor overall, but we are the number one by capita by virtue of having a population a quarter the size of China's While the United States has in many ways been the leader in pioneering techonology to reduce greenhouse gasses, our technology is nowhere near good enough to solve this problem. As Ken pointed out in the first lecture, Technocrats are neither sufficient nor will they be for another few decades, which by then could be enough time to irreparably harm our environment. I take issue with your statement that India has continued to increase emissions, because by the Paris Agreement standards, India is the only country to meet the reductions specified in the agreement. 


The lecture shed light on the issue in a unique way. The smoking analogy was one I had not heard before. I found that analogy to be rather effective in communicating our need to take action towards the problems posed by climate change. I also agree that people will not take action until they are themselves experiencing the effects of climate change-- hopefully it will not be too late by then. I believe that education, activism, and voting are critical to garnering enough public support in order to enact change.

    I agree with what you said. Climate change is changing our life or even destroying our life. I also really interested about the cigarette part.

    This whole situation is saturated with irony and injustice. We were born into a country that is proud of their disgusting abuse of our planet. Our politicians will defend profits over lives any day.  Climate disasters are already being caused on a scale never before seen in recorded history, and we can’t even provide them sufficient resources to recover. I’m thinking specifically of Hurricane Maria, when a US Territory was struck with a climate disaster and the president refused to provide relief. 
 Throughout history, developed nations have stayed developed at the expense of developing nations. The way the U.S. hoards natural resources and destroys the world without a care is the newest form of quiet imperialism. Other nations will be weakened by climate disasters we have caused until they have no choice but to reach out for help. I was reminded how disgusted I am constantly by my country. This is a disturbing dystopia we are living in, where we all ignore our direct impacts on our environment.

    I completely agree with you Savannah, and think that its a shame how hypocritical the US is. That's why I really enjoyed Sunita Narain's commentary on the US in Before the Flood, and her emphasis on the weak response that the US has had towards climate change. The US constitution and amendments in a way, are very outdated because they don't directly discuss how we has a nation should address and protect ourselves from climate change. This is reflective of the fact many of the most prominent politicians are funded by the fossil fuel industry, and its sort of a stretch to say that any will be willing enough to revise the US constitution to address such a pressing issue. Sadly, today I can't imagine a world that would address climate change is such a direct manner, like in the example you gave with gas stations. I would like there to be a world like that, and I think its now in our hands to make sure we give that world to the rising generations.

    I think that you made a really good point about our society creating such a negative impact on everyone else for our own pleasures and similarly how we have collectively decided to reduce smoking for our own health while having no parallel actions taken to do the same for the health of our earth and everyone around us. I think it shows how selfish we are as a society and how most people truly only think about themselves and what makes them happiest in the moment. I think that the creation of the saying "YOLO" has really influenced the way people act in this new generation as people view everything with a lax attitude and think that we have to live hard and fast rather than be cautious and attempt to preserve the world for the future and at this point ourselves in near times due to the extreme declining rate of the world. 
    <br><br>
Your analogy about gas stations is really interesting and I think that if we were proactive, actions would be taken like that as we have seen success from the similar smoking campaigns and know that public criticism can make an impact if done correctly. Like you said, people won't get it until its too late just like how people only realized smoking was so bad after millions died from it and its really unfortunate that society works that way.

    I totally agree with what you're saying.  It is noticeable that the human race would much rather avoid the truth about climate change than learn about it and be living in fear constantly.  That's why you're right when you say "people will not understand the danger until it is staring them right in the face." Which is why people would rather just avoid it as a whole.  Which is why, hypothetically, if there were to be some sort of law about having to know the danger everyday activities have on the earth, things may change.  Unfortunately it is only a hypothetical idea as of now.  But it would work, tying cigarette usage into this it is very true that there was a huge point in time when people finally started realizing the health effects of smoking cigarettes were extremely dangerous. Not only is the warning on cigarette packs themselves, everyday theres a new ad on TV to widely publicize this as well.  What if we had to watch a minute long video about the negative effects of fast fashion before being able to purchase something from Forever 21?  It would force people to stop, think, and hopefully make a change.

    I thought your comment was very powerful, and felt your opinion was very progressive, passionate, and enlightened. I am very shocked to hear all of these horrible things we are doing to our planet, and although everyone has most likely heard of it, I doubt 99% of people are familiar with the lengths we have gone to sacrifice our planet for our corporate interests. I think the bulk of our discussion on this topic should be focused on solution. It is apparent that human's are causing devastating climate change, and I think once everyone is informed of this reality it will be easier to shift the discussion to a solution-oriented mindset. It is much easier to point out all of the problems in our system, but developing a plan of action and implementing it in every way that we can to save this planet will definitely be a challenge. I am eager to learn what we can do to improve the state of our home, as well as if there are any concrete plans/how long this would take before we started seeing some change. Perhaps all of this is rooted in our western-culture of desiring materialistic things to the point of disregarding morality. Again, very well written comment.

     definitely agree with you, but the U.S is just an epitome of developed countries on polluting the carbon dioxide into the air. The developed countries, or most of the countries, can not stand without releasing carbon dioxide. The factory needs to be open. On the other hand, pollution is closely associated with the economy of a country. There is no way for a country to not produce anything, pollution becomes unnecessary. What is important is that human needs to find renewable energy that can sustain the development of modern society without further harming the earth.

We need to stop being selfish with our consumption and realize that we are affecting so many other people. I also really like how you take the cigarette example and continue to examine what gas stations could look like if they were to follow what cigarette packages have done.

    I believe most of us had the same reaction when learning about the disparity in the ratio of CO2 generated by the leading developed countries in the country compared to the "3 billion poorest people from undeveloped countries." Being originally from an underdeveloped third world country, I know for a fact that the underdeveloped countries who lack the technological capabilities that, allow us to perpetuate our fossil fuel addiction will be left without resources to combat the already aggravating effects of the climate crisis. One good example of this scenario is the Philippines. Since early 2015, more than 40 percent of the Philippines has been experiencing severe drought triggered by El-Niño (The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies). This caused the loss of agriculture production amounting to 82 million US dollars. The drought brought by El-Niño affected water supplies and the livelihoods of several towns in Cebu. With time the Philippines became more developed with the influence of years of colonialism and this results in the Philippines generating its own part in polluting the world. However, most of that pollution was in their waters. The main source of pollution is untreated domestic and industrial wastewater. Yet, we suffer severely from excessive amounts of CO2 left in the atmosphere. 

    <br><br>
In the anthropogenic era, major civilizations enjoy the consumption of fossil fuels in their consumerism minded, capitalist centered industries, leaving future generations and faultless civilizations to the dire consequences. Yes, the temporal delay of the consequences of excessive CO2 in our atmosphere is what allowed this to happen but that shouldn't be an excuse. We're past the stage of making excuses, even radical action is not conceived to be enough to completely solve the threat of climate crisis. I definitely feel the same shame that Ken expressed in the video. But I hope that by continuing to learn facts and solutions, I will be able to be a start and changing our consumerist habits that are affecting everyone globally.

    The United States has never been about “justice for all” as seen from early times of America with the unfair treatment of our Native Americans to slavery and of course with this issue of climate change. Of course America has done well as a nation and has prospered, but wouldn’t have it been much better if the U.S. did so without committing so many injustices? Unfortunately, merely pointing out this climate injustice will not bring an end to it. Our cry and protest for justice is not enough to fight against the driving force of this climate injustice, which is wealth and money. This money and wealth that is being attained at the expense of our planet and that is creating dangers for the humans on this planet; Dangers that will do more harm to those not contributing to the problem at a huge level. This is unfair and extremely sad. 

    <br><br>
    I love how you added to the excellent analogy with cigarettes made by the professor and then made an excellent point. I absolutely agree that people will not begin to change until the danger is staring them right in the face. For this reason, professor Hiltner has decided to apologize for his generation, for having a delayed response to this severe issue. He also apologized for perhaps raising us into this lifestyle of living in an unsustainable way. I hope that this generation can destroy this lifestyle and live one that is centered around taking care of the earth. It is unfair that someone who is working hard towards fixing the issue has to apologize. But as professor Hiltner said, this is an issue that has been caused in a single lifetime. Hopefully, it can be solved in another single lifetime.

    I agree with what you said. How can the United States claim liberty and justice for all? But then be the number 1 country for creating the largest injust of all, destroying our home. But Americans don't think that way for the most part. If we as Americans can't see a bad outcome right away then its as if the consequence does not exist to us. It is known worldwide that Americans are the most selfish greedy people there are. This is only proven by how much of our earth we are willing to consume and destroy in hopes of making lives for ourselves better. Without thinking about the consequences of what it does, especially to developing countries, who don't use nearly as many resources as us but have to bear the brunt of American's selfishness. 
      <br><br>
    I really enjoyed the example of how people smoked heavily until a few years ago when all of the studies came out proving that smoking was indeed very bad for your health. Even when all of the studies started to break about smoking there were so many respected doctors and physicians that were advising that cigarettes were not nearly as bad as the scientists were making it seem and a few years before doctors were actually prescribing cigarettes to patients. This is a great comparison to the climate crisis. Coal and fossil fuels were the big new deal in the past, the healthier alternative, the best method. Now that the scientists are coming out and saying how much we really are damaging the earth people are very leery to accept it because of how much it was pushed in the past.

    I agree completely with everything you said; it's completely absurd that developed nations can get away with saying some nice words about how they exist for the people and base their very constitutions on it when in fact they are doing the bare minimum to guarantee the safety of all, especially regarding climatic changes. Instead, they choose to use organizations such as the UN to try and regulate smaller nations in hopes of compensating the damages they caused. 
    <br><br>
    As with smoking, sugar, fat, etc. everything gets demystified at some point, but it only happens when political interests are aligned. To me personally, I believe the American government won't take a significant stance on the climate change issue until lobbyists rally up for an unknown reason to support the cause, which is very unlikely given that they work for the very industries that are currently benefitting from CO2 emissions

    I think your response is very interesting and insightful. I agree with your comment about how the climate crisis will continue to get worse until it is widely publicized and staring people in the face. It would be so cool if gas stations were forced to label the harmful effects of fossil fuel usage. Ken's analogy of cigarette smoking works really well in my opinion because it shows how fossil fuel usage is an addiction. It is an addiction and has become many people's way of life. I think that is a good way of describing it because it explains why so many people are stuck in their ways and cannot stop using fossil fuels. Ken also makes a good point when he mentions how his generation was the main cause of the climate crisis and how his generation raised the rising generation. This causes the rising generation (us) to have a fossil fuel addiction as well.

    I am replying to your comment in full agreement. I think humans are unaware of the consequences of their actions until it hits them hard in the face, and only then will they change their ways, when often it is too late or far too much damage has been done. It is incredibly unfair of the United States to not take into account the billions of other people they are affecting, and the future generations to come. Developing countries will not be able to combat the uninhabitable future of our world, and their future generations will not be able to survive. We will lose valuable people, cultures, traditions, ecosystems, wildlife, etc. that inhabit these parts of the world all because of the U.S. and their excessive use of carbon in the air. 
    <br><br>
    t makes me sick to think that politicians and big businesses ignore our potentially inevitable fate if their actions continue. I agree that these consequences need to be publicized, anywhere and everywhere so that with each daily action a human makes, they think about what could possibly come from it. Each human in this present day and age is responsible for the future generations and the earth itself.

    I agree. Before watching these videos I thought the way we treat our planet is incredibly stupid but was unaware of how unfair the consequences of climate change were. Similar to "The Uninhabitable Earth," this video made me feel kind of hopeless for the planet and for people in developing countries who feel the brunt of the effects of climate change. Obviously each citizen of the world is responsible for living sustainably, but thinking about the incredibly powerful forces perpetuating unsustainable lifestyles in our country alone is scary. From politicians to banks such as Chase who have almost all of their money invested in fossil fuels to the auto industry, my generation and those that come after us are in a very difficult spot. It feels in some way to be just another injustice imposed by the elites upon everyone else. Hopefully now that people are mobilizing, things will change

    When I heard that only 4% of earth's population contributed so much carbon emissions I immediately became enraged. How can so few people do that much damage? And in such short time! It's almost as if they knew about the impacts of climate change for years and decided to expand and use as much fossil fuels as they can before anyone stops them. And no one has been stopping them yet. The poorest 3 BILLION only contributed 5%. Unbelievable. I can't even imagine how many day to day things we take advantage of that we are using carbon emissions for. And it's awful that those poorest 3 billion are going to feel the consequences the most. 
    <br><br>
    I thought his smoking analogy was interesting. It also made me think about how popular smoking used to be and how many people thought there weren’t consequences because the tobacco companies paid to put out false information. I however did not think about how the climate crisis could be less severe and more people would try to protect the earth if the consequences were publicized more frequently. Honestly if that’s what it takes for some people to care then let’s do it. But we gotta be doing something soon because so many people have denied it for the reasoning like the delayed response time. It’ll take some work to get us on track to help the planet, but we will fight the good fight until we can’t anymore.

    My dad always asks me why the US should be the ones to have to "lead the way" in repairing the damage we've done to the earth and for the most part the best answer i could give him is that we were the most influential. But like you i was appalled to hear that we 4% of the world contributed 25% of the problem. I am able to tell him now that we have to fix the problem because we caused the problem. And like you I now know the first step to fixing the problem is to make people aware of the problem by putting it right in front of their face everyday.

    I completely agree with your argument and I’m glad you talked about all the pride the United States has when portraying itself to not only other nations but it’s people as well. The U.S. fails to recognize its flaws and all the damage that it is causing to our planet. We risk the lives of every single living thing because of the selfishness and entitlement we get by living here and we exploit all of our resources rather than handle them with caution and placing limits on how much we intake these harmful gases. The U.S. should work on advocating for change and we really should see more of the dangers caused when we do regular everyday things in hope to see less and less of it occurring.

    I agree with your comment. "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" puts in perspective the amount of damage done over in such a short period of time relative to the Earth's timeline and the existence of life. Not only that, but the ones that are contributing to this problem, the 4%, will not suffer the brunt of the consequences of large greenhouse gas emissions nearly as much as the rest of the human population who had so little to do with it. It is of upmost importance that laws change to benefit the people rather than the greed of those that own oil companies. The war against climate change is clearly one that takes place on all levels of society. 
    <br><br>
    The dire situation just go to show that not only do we need to change our wasteful habits and put in effect preventative and recovery procedures, but will also require the power of the people to change its governments to value preservation over wealth. Drastic measures must be taken to stop the progression to humanity's imminent doom. Unfortunately, many of those at the forefront of the problem will not act until the effects can be seen within their own backyards.
    <br><br>
    </span>
    <hr><br>
     <span>
    I agree with your analysis. In addition, I think that it is important to note that, were all the people that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions fully aware of the consequences of their actions ahead of time, then the vast majority of them would have chosen a different course of action, even at the cost of their economic prosperity. While all people, especially in America, would love to have limitless wealth, wealth is so trivial in comparison to the apocalyptic future we will likely face. What is supposed to separate human beings from most other animals is the ability to rationalize, and yet, when it matters most, when the stakes are highest, the thought that the entire species could spontaneously fail is nearly impossible to imagine. So with that context, the disproportionate effects on the climate from such a small fraction of the population makes some amount of sense, however, despite their intentions, at some point the impact of the outcome becomes more important than the intention behind the action. While I do not think that ever person from the generations prior owes the world an apology, I firmly believe that the developed nations that have put us in this situation owe the poorest people in the world much more than an apology, and they should do everything within their power to further the economic advancement of developing nations without the negative ramifications of economic development that we are now witnessing.

      I agree with you in the fact that people that may not be informed about climate crisis can be using small, powerful labels like you suggested. When looking at the looming idea of the climate crisis, it can be very overwhelming on where to start to create change. 
     But, by dividing the large climate crisis issue into smaller, more manageable issues, we can start to move in the right direction. I believe that the climate crisis won't be solved tomorrow or even in the next few years, so the idea of radical change to me is absurd as I think continue and stead change will outweigh radical change in the long run.
<br><br>
    It is also absurd to me that the 'first-world country' United States is a major contributor to the problem yet we continue to try and find others to blame for our doing. A major step needs to be acceptance of the blame because the climate crisis is a modern 21st issue and it's not going anywhere from our view soon. Our generation entering the 'adult world' needs to be the forefront of creating change and informing others which sounds like a daunting task but I look at it as if our generation doesn't start change, the following generation may be too late and will have to ultimately accept the inevitable. This may sound scary because it is for the most part, but for me personally, I would be more disappointed leaving this world to the future in greater fracture than it in currently.
<br><br>
    I have a question that is summarized from the lectures:
<br><br>
    While I feel like I have the ability to influence change in those that may come after me, how can I influence those before me that my not care about the world in the future?

    I find it equally as disgusting that humans are doing this to the planet as they have been doing harm to themselves through the use of cigarettes. It was really eye-opening hearing this analogy. In response to the part about people not understanding the risks until it's right in front of them reminds me of the concept of 'slow violence' that I learned from Environmental Studies 1. Slow violence describes the slow, gradual effects of climate change that make it easier for people to overlook the consequences of their actions. This seems like a perfect example of slow violence.

    I'm astounded by this comment, in a good way, I really appreciate the way you articulated the injustices that are occurring. It's mind-boggling that in a span of only 60-years (a really really small amount of time compared to Earth's long history) humans managed to emit so much carbon to the point where we are now in the middle of a sixth mass extinction. It's infuriating to know that the wealthiest people are the ones who created and exacerbated the circumstances that got us here, and those who have contributed the least will be the ones who are most impacted by the climate crisis. I also think it's worth noting that people in the United States, particularly black and brown folks, are disproportionately impacted as well which just adds on to the irony of the "savior" and "hero" mindset that the US has. Despite all the science and knowledge that we know about the horrible impacts of business as usual, the US has taken virtually no steps to combatting the crisis which even more infuriating. Tying that into the lecture, I think the cigarette analogy is a perfect way for framing the climate crisis because the people who put us here still don't care about the consequences because they are more interested in accumulating wealth and power rather than trying to avoid the myriad of disasters that climate change will bring upon.

    I completely agree with you! It is absolutely disappointing to see how much amount of carbon emissions are being released into the planet from each country. It is so ironic to see how selfish human beings are and only focus on themselves when in reality this issue is affecting every single one of us in this planet. And how politics play a role in climate change is infuriating. If we lived by the ideals that is in the pledge of allegiance, the politicians should by doing more or at least try to make a difference about the environment. But they're too busy and selfish to push their own agenda for their reputation. Justice should be emphasized for everyone's good, not our and politician's greed.

    History has taught us the poorest, most marginalized, and mistreated societies and people will always pay for the consequences of the privileged groups. 
    <br><br>
    4% of the earths population (us) has contributed such a vast amount of carbon emissions while the poorest 3 billion have contributed only 5%. I feel like the climate crisis will continue to get worse until it's consequences affect the people that make up the major corporations responsible for the amazed carbon footprint. The burning of fossil fuels started 400 years ago in Shakespeare's time, a quarter of all the Co2 in the air has been emitted in the past 60 years. It has taken millions of years for the Earth to adapt to the 280 parts per million, which was the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 400 years ago. All the living things on the planet cannot possibly adopt within a short time span to accommodate this drastic changes within our lifetimes.

    I completely agree with your comment Savannah. I love the first part about the pledge of allegiance and would have never thought to make that even a point. It is truly disgusting to see those statistics and it's sad to even say that the 5% of those countries will receive the worst of our countries consequences and they wouldn't be able to have the power/money to do anything about it. I also agree with the need to widely publicize the danger we are committing to our planet and all life on earth. But majority of the people don't realize the consequences until it's far too late and this is something we can't let get to that point.

    I agree with your opinion that people will not start to recognize how severe our environmental status has become before the consequence start to show up or publicized. It is very important to let people know the consequence. 
It is difficult to make sure that all people consume resources fairly, but it is a good beginning if every one of us who watches this video start to consume less and generate less pollution from now on.

    I also think that the foundation our country was built upon does not live up to its own basic principles. It is crazy to think that a large number of the poorest of people on our planet don't contribute nearly as much carbon emissions as a single person does in our country. This is true for other countries as well and just to think how lucky we are to be able to live good lifestyles compared to poor people and we still act ungrateful and unaware to the ongoing crisis we have. Still, people will not wake up until they feel the wrath of the consequences, which is how poor people feel on a daily basis. In addition, smoking used to be a norm for the entire world until the effects actually starting kicking in and people became sick. I completely agree that once you're face to face with the consequences then this delayed response will happen.

I'd like to start off this comment by expressing my appreciation to Ken and the rest of the boomers who are supporting us in this fight to save our planet. Ken, if you are reading this, thank you for teaching us the mistakes of your past and showing us that we don't have to repeat them. 
<br><br>
Even is the burning of fossil fuels started 400 years ago in Shakespeare's time, a quarter of all the Co2 in the air has been emitted in the past 60 years. This is incredibly frightening considering its taken millions of years for the Earth to adapt to the 280 parts per million, which was the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 400 years ago. All the living things on the planet cannot possibly change their DNA to accommodate this drastic change in merely a few decades. 
<br><br>
Humans are selfish because of this, specifically westernised humans (Europeans and Americans) whose emissions together equal 2/3 of the world's population. This is ironic because the climate crisis will hit everyone else the hardest. Islanders' homes are already flooding, underwater. People in India are experiencing monsoons worse than ever before seen. 
<br><br>
America and other westernized nations have become this advanced because of the consumption of natural resources and emitting as much CO2 as they have. With this advancement, these westernized nations must come together and fund green energy for less develpoped countries, so they don't end up taking the route we have.

  As professor Hiltner explains the climate crisis was mainly created in a single life time and not over the course of many years. With the people who created this problem still alive this shows how badly society has negatively impacted Earth's environment in such a small amount of time. The little things people did add up and created this huge problem. We need to change our ways and start positively helping out Earth and the environment. We need to do this immediately.
  </span></div>

In Hiltner’s lecture video, he makes an intriguing scenario. By putting the consequences of global warming in a less controversial matter, you cannot help but see the damage and similarities in result of human anthropogenic climate forcing. Hiltner also uses an interesting phrase, “fossil fuel addiction.” According to the Oxford dictionary, the definition of addicted is “physically and mentally dependent on a particular substance, and unable to stop taking it without incurring adverse effects.” Addiction is the perfect word to explain why many people who do not benefit from preventing climate change cannot get onboard with the movement. Hiltner brings up a different perspective on people and their opinion on global warming that I have not thought of. In the video, he discusses how the climate crisis became so extreme within one lifetime. Now, you can imagine many people would not be willing to change their lifestyles due to living the luxuries they have right now. But, to what expense? 
<br><br>
I sort of have an understanding of why there are around eight hundred students in this class. At first, I thought that life must suck for the TAs. However, now watching how passionate our professor is regarding the issue, I understand that the immense size of the class showcases the urgency to make our world habitable for not only ourselves but future generations to come. I appreciate Hiltner's apology, and I hope that we will be able to turn the situation around in everybody's favor.

  I enjoyed reading your response. I agree that Americans have a fossil fuel addiction but it will take more than just convincing to give up their ways. The climate change skeptics do not believe it is even a real issue in the first place and will continue with their same habits. Those who do agree will not want to give up their cheap products or fast food that are only possible by exporting the earth's natural resources. Those in power like politicians who have the ability to reach thousands on this serious issue still continue to deny it because it is in their best interest when the oil companies are funding their campaigns. I believe they choose not to care because at the moment, it is not impacting directly but they will see when it's their grandchildren trying to fix those issues. Just like Hiltner said in the lecture, there is an environmental injustice when the poor people feel the direct impacts of climate change but the wealthy remain largely unaffected although they are the ones with the big carbon footprint. 
  <br><br>
  I also thought this was such a large amount of people for an English course but after this week's lectures, I completely understand. Hiltner's dedication and passion for the climate change issue are inspiring. I also appreciate his apology because I know many people from his generation would refuse to admit that they had anything to do with it or even admit it even exists. But I still find it frustrating that nothing is being done to change the way things are headed and leaving the planet uninhabitable for future generations.

  I really liked how you included the definition of addiction in your response - it made the idea of a fossil fuel addiction even more clear. He also mentions how we (our generation) may have inherited this same dependency... exactly the same way that many addictions can be passed down by parents' genetics. This makes it even more apparent that we are going to have to be the ones to break this cycle. In light of that daunting responsibility, the size of this class and the resulting exposure to all of this incredibly important information is a step in the right direction.

  I completely agree with you, Sarah. Professor Hiltner’s use of the smoking scenario to illustrate the negative impacts we face today due to climate change was extremely moving and made it easier to grasp the idea of the climate crisis in a creative way. I also found your use of the definition of “addiction” to be a compelling argument that tied into professor Hiltner’s lecture, adding emphasis to the people who single-handedly contributed to climate change in one lifetime. It is truly heartbreaking to see the statistics that the U.S., Europe, and Russia are responsible for ⅔ of all CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. To think that half of the world’s population had little to nothing to do with causing the climate crisis but will suffer the most and the first consequences are awful. This was also seen in the film, An Inconvenient Sequel when Pope Francis traveled to Tacloban after a typhoon where he gave a speech in which he said the “gravest effects of climate change are experienced by the poorest.” Professor Hiltner’s apology was sincere and heartwarming as most of his generation would not take the blame for the climate crisis we are facing today. However, people like professor Hiltner, the people in this class, and people in the documentaries and literature we read in this class gives me hope that our generation and future generations can strive to fix the climate crisis ahead of us.

“The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” both paint an accurate portrayal of the climate crisis through the perspective of responsibility (who created this issue), affects (who it will affect), and what (we can do about it).
<br><br>
Put simply, America has created more than five times the damage as populations much bigger than us, for example Africa. As said in lecture, posing that larger populations and overpopulation are the ones to blame for the climate crisis could really be racist as it is so far from the truth. It is so incredibly unfortunate that the poor, helpless populations--big or small will have to suffer the effects of the mess we created burning all these fossil fuels and being excessive, uneducated consumer. This poses another issue that Ken discussed in these lectures. Many of us are very privileged and have unlimited access to resources that could quickly explain what we could do right now to help the planet, yet we procrastinate and react too slowly to this issue that is coming all too fast. Our “reaction time” is not up to par and will not be ready when the flood comes. 
<br><br>
On a positive note, it is our generation that can step up and be informed citizens who will help the planet and spread the knowledge that needs to be heard so that everyone “believes” if they do not already. Like previous comments have mentioned this issue needs to be mass publicized and incorporated into every act and law the government passes. The climate crisis needs to be considered in every action each person takes every day and that is how we will build a safer and more promising tomorrow.
</p><hr>


<p>
Especially after watching “Before the Flood”, I have caught myself thinking “How did we allow this to happen? How have we known about this for decades and have made no real progress?”. These lecture videos drove that point even further for me. It is infuriating that we have allowed this issue to continue, exponentially creating worse effects in the future, without any compromise. It is maddening that there are a small number of key players in the fossil fuel industry who have so much blame for the harm of our planet and the harm of future generations. 
<br><br>
However, I do feel an astounding sense of hope among my generation to work for climate action. Although we do not deserve the weight of solving problems that we did not cause, I see that many people are willing to stand up and fight. Additionally, I see many young people supporting progressive politicians calling for radical climate action. As this voting population only becomes bigger and bigger, we will have more power to sway public opinion and get politicians to listen. I believe that this effort in casting votes for climate action and reducing gridlock on climate issues is our only hope in combating climate change.
</p><hr>

<p>
I would like to say first that watching this makes me feel vindicated. It’s rare and refreshing that an older person personally acknowledges that Generation Z and millennials are, in fact, correct about climate change and not just “trying to kill the (insert industry that uses/digs up fossil fuels here)” or something.  I’m glad that he acknowledges that as part of that generation, he does owe us an apology and vowed to stand with us.
<br><br>
That being said, I’m not sure I entirely agree with the assertion that the time delay between action and impact was a major reason that the climate crisis was not stopped up to this point. My issue with this is twofold: 1) misinformation and suppression of information on the part of major corporations played—and continue to play — a huge role in keeping the public uninformed about the full cause and effect of climate change, and 2) the impact of releasing carbon dioxide did have more obvious impacts on humans and the planet...it’s just that this impact tended to be in developing countries where we in the western world didn’t notice. According to an EU report, ecological zone shifts, droughts and disappearing glaciers has reduced agricultural production in parts of the world that can barely manage as it is, though it also does note a lack of studies done in these areas. It is worth noting that though developed countries have a bigger increase in temperature, most developed countries are also in places with cooler and/or milder climates (Canada, Europe, most of the United States versus, say, Africa or Latin America) and developing countries were disproportionately impacted relative to their contribution .
<br><br>
OK, I’m just going to finish this comment by saying I liked the cigarette analogy. Regardless of my previous points against time delay, this is the narrative most people had and therefore acted on.

While i found the entirety of what Ken had to say in this video riveting, a few key points stood out to me. The concept that the Climate Crisis has been brought about in a single life time is not one which is new to me but something I have considered at length. Ken's reference to the "fossil fuel addiction" that his generation has passed on to subsequent generations, has its roots in earlier times when the benefits of fossil fuel exploitation first came to light. As he points out, it was not his generation that discovered this technological benefit, however, they are the generation which streamlined it and made it a major staple of the modern economy. They made humanity dependent on fossil fuels for our way of life, hence the addiction metaphor becomes a terrifying reality. His question as to how his generation will be remembered throughout history struck me in more than one sense. First, it reminded me of the reading in which Wallace Wells likened the effects of climate change to the effects of the age of exploration and how the generation responsible for "discovering the world" would later be remembered. This parallel illustrates two key points about climate change in an extremely effective manner: the correlation between human advancement and catastrophe as well as the exploitation of the underdeveloped. Ken references both of these points earlier in his video, however, I feel as though the comparison made in the reading expands upon this concept providing us with a historical reference point and possibly answering Kens question. Additionally, his question provoked me to ask the same question about my generation. Being born in 2001 I maintain the unique quality of not feeling fully subscribed to the aggressive activism of millennial culture nor do I fully relate to the pessimistic passivity of Gen Z, I think many of my peers can relate. However, whichever generation you do identify with I feel as though we can all agree that we have been tasked with an extremely pivotal choice: will we be known as the generation who sparked a change in humanity or will we fall into the same pattern of self destruction as our parents and their parents before them? Moreover, should we decide to make a change, will our generation be able to have any lasting effects on the state of the globe or will we fall short of our task? Gen Z is simply a generic term to describe the latest generation and the title is assumed to be replaced by one more fitting as we grow and mature to take on our own set of defining characteristics, but the title caries an immense sense of irony. We will either be the generation to end the exploitation of fossil fuels or we will be the last generation before the world truly feels apocalyptic effects of climate change.

<p>
When watching the first lecture video, there were many times where I was left shocked and speechless. The most alarming thing that I learned was the fact that the U.S, Russia, and Europe are responsible for 66.67% of all the CO2 emitted to the planet’s atmosphere. The poorest three billion people in the world only contributed to 5% of the planet’s CO2 emissions. This made me realize that those located in least developed countries are the ones being the most affected. In addition to them, the future generations will also suffer the consequences of our actions. Professor Hiltner also noted that in twenty years or so, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere can increase from 415 PPM to 455 PPM, which would be catastrophic for our environment. Originally, it was 280 PPM, but it rose dramatically more, and in the last 60 years, it has risen 100 points.
<br><br>
I liked how Professor Hiltner compared the global warming crisis to smoking a pack of cigarettes with no side effects, because that is how much of the population is treating the situation. After watching the short video, I realized that in order to stop global warming, we should try to unite against powerful fossil fuel companies. If this was done, the earth’s current state would improve greatly and animal populations could be preserved.
<br><br>
I found Professor Hiltner’s apology at the end of the video very moving and admirable. Personally, I do not think he should feel too bad because it is impossible to control the actions of millions of people. Hopefully my generation, and the generations yet to come are going to be able to improve the state of our planet and keep CO2 levels from increasing even more. I am optimistic about the future, and I will try to do everything that I can to preserve what we have left.
</p><hr>

<p>
The video “How climate crisis brought about in a single life” was quite impressive for me. And the most shocking part is the developed countries account for 66.67% emission of CO2, the major culprit to the global warming, while the poorest three billion people account for only 5% of the CO2 emission. The contrast is ironic. People in developed countries,  the major ones to blame for causing climate change, enjoy affluent life brought by burning the fossil fuel. Even though they have to use climate change in exchange for the high-tech era, the countries have enough money to improve the environment which has suffered pollution due to the burning fossil fuel. But for the people in the poorest countries, which account for a pretty insignificant amount of emission of CO2, have suffered the same, even worse consequence brought by burning the fossil fuel. The polluted environment may well bring some diseases which then increase the death rate of countries since those poorest people could not afford the treatment fee. 
<br><br>
Professor HIltner also mentioned how the astonishing increase rate of concentration of CO2 within a single generation in the lecture. From 315 ppm in 1959 to 415 ppm in 2019, in the past 60 years, CO2 has risen by 100 points, which is a shocking number. And we are still devoting in increasing that number since most of us are unaware of the damage the global warming will bring to us. And professor Hiltner makes a genuine apology in the end which strikes me deeply. He says that the last generation, including himself, left us, the younger generation, with a planet on its way to becoming largely uninhabitable and unwelcoming  for our species and are reluctant to correct their mistakes. In my opinion, we, as the younger generation, can start to correct those mistakes from now on.

<p>
Starting from the second of the two lecture videos, “How the Climate Crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” filled me with rage and confusion. The fact that the people responsible for this crisis are still alive and continue this push towards environmental despair is incredibly frustrating; corporations in the 20th century may have been able to feign ignorance about their actions before, but today there is just no excuse. The cigarette analogy that Professor Hiltner made also adds to the anger that I, and my generation, feels. There are numbers to back this rage since, a quarter of this carbon dioxide now in the atmosphere was emitted by the United States, and CO2 has risen from 280 parts per million all the way to 415 ppm according to the lecture. To have one country, my own country, be so wasteful and contribute so greatly to the decline of the world leaves me with a sickening feeling, to say the least. Yet, there is still hope. 
<br><br>
There are people from older generations to back the action that today’s generation is taking. In "The Climate Crisis as a generational issue", it is clear that people from across the globe are educating themselves on the matter and want to make as big of an impact as possible. Although we cannot completely reverse the damage that has been done to Earth, I completely agree with Professor Hiltner and believe that it is not yet too late. Major changes to legislation need to be made, and quickly, but I believe that with the increasing number of people (regardless of age) who are enraged with the state of the world we can still repair our broken planet.

"Ok boomer" is a recent term that has been taking up the internet, we all know the memes, this video reminds me of this meme. This is the new generations anger towards the older generation for leaving us with the current world. The climate crisis was a problem created by this older generation and now it is a problem that my generation will have to fix. Although, fixing seems as if it has yet to begin as the older generations are still the ones making the decisions for us. Like prof. Hiltner says "these people are still alive and still doing exactly what they did". There is so much action and protest that we students can take, but it seems almost helpless when the generation that saw no problem creating the climate crisis are the ones in power. My hopes are that children all over the world will be taught about this issue so as we rise to control we will all be on the same side fighting the climate crisis.

This video was very interesting. I never really thought about how the delayed effects of climate change makes it easier for us to ignore the consequences of our actions. I think generally speaking, we want to believe that whatever we're doing is okay. the delayed effects of our actions make it easier to tell ourselves that our actions are okay. This was very eye opening.
</p><hr>

<p>
I respect the fact that, in the first video, Ken recognizes the growing interest of the climate crisis in teenagers today as I agree with him 100%. I also agree with his point that the generation before us chose to ignore the signs of climate change, leaving us in the position of having to quickly find a solution. Before coming to UCSB, I was aware of climate change but did not have much basic knowledge of how prominent it is in my own life. Even though I am merely a student, I have the responsibility of taking care of my planet and am now learning about the many possibilities there are to be conscious of my carbon footprint. The intro video made me even more excited for this course, as I am hoping to gain much from it. 
<br><br>
The second video, “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, was just as eye opening as the first. I found it very interesting how Ken decided to talk about the climate crisis in the context of his birth year, 1959, as he claims it could have been the year of a turning point for our planet. Before this, I had no idea that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere had risen 100 points since that year and now, to me that number is alarming. I also found Ken’s pie chart representing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere each country has contributed very interesting. To think that the United States alone takes up a quarter of the chart, while the poorest 3 billion people in the world only take up 5% is, for the lack of a better word, crazy. As the video concluded, I was left still thinking of the fact that the people who have made the biggest impact on CO2 emissions are most likely still alive. From the viewpoint of Professor Hiltner, his generation are the ones that created this catastrophe.
</p><hr>

<p>
The two lectures, “how the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” and “The climate crisis as a generation issue”, Hiltner discusses the differing mindsets between the past generations and our generation. Hiltner uses 1959 as a reference to prove that the past generation alone has contributed to an incredible portion of the climate crisis, yet only the youth will suffer the consequences. The lecture states that in the past 60 years, CO2 has risen by 100ppm which is more than 3x what it had risen since the beginning of fossil fuels. To me this is shocking. I now am realizing just how much of an impact one generation has had on the entire globe. What's worse is because there are still many climate deniers often influenced by large corporations who want fossil fuels to remain profitable, we are still not acting enough on the problem. If the last generation caused this much of an issue, our generation will hit new records of CO2 added to the atmosphere if we don’t act. We can’t do exactly what the generation before us did. We experienced the unfairness, we should know not to repeat it. Another shocking statistic is that the United States produced 1/4 of the fossil fuel emission, despite only holding 4% of the world's population. What's worse is that while our wealth shields us from the harms of climate change, poorer countries won’t be as lucky. This is extremely unfair and is a classic example of western nations gaining at the expense of other human beings. I feel it is our duty as the younger generation to change this. If we continue to selfishly indulge at the expense of others, we are no better than past generations.
</p><hr>

<p>
In this lecture video, I found it particularly intriguing that within just a single lifetime, we have done more damage than ever before and continue to damage our earth exponentially creating a future which can potentially be toxic for generations to come. The fact that our CO2 emissions can reach 455 PPM within twenty years is both astonished and depressing to hear, mostly due to knowing that human beings have produced more CO2 in the atmosphere than the human race did for the whole of our history. This makes me think particularly about the generations of children growing up with a different world than their parents grew up in, vastly different in temperature, and even different in terms of how the world's cities might look with rising sea levels. 

There is much to be angry about when I begin to think about the hypocrisy and irony of the climate change issue, specifically, those who are doing most of the polluting contrary to those who are being affected the most. This climate injustice is saddening to think about but must be explained to the many developed societies around the world to educate them in regards to their impact and responsibility to the future. I greatly appreciated Kens apology towards the end of the video as many of us should feel the need to apologize and help mitigate the crisis for future generations to come.
</p><hr>

<p>
Before watching this lecture, despite feeling like I knew the level of responsibility the US holds for our current climate crisis, I really didn't know how quickly such a small percentage of people caused so much damage to our planet. Some of the statistics Ken brought up were especially upsetting to me -- like the fact that the US and Europe, despite making up only 1/8 of the world's total population, have caused 2/3 of all emissions while the 3 billion poorest people have only contributes to 5% of emissions... This lecture made me angry about climate change on a new level. While I understand what Ken said in the beginning about the boomer generation not fully recognizing the consequences of their actions, we clearly have passed that point. Climate change has been a confirmed threat for long enough for positive change to have been initiated, and yet we are still only worsening the situation. 
<br><br>
The phrase Ken used to describe out generation -- "inheriting a fossil fuel addiction" -- really stuck with me. I don't think I ever explicitly blamed the prior generation for the continuation of global warming; I always just blamed society as a whole. But what's said at the end of this lecture is true. Every person with kids who is teaching them to live the same kind of life they lived is contributing greatly to the issue. Parents are passing down extremely careless and harmful behaviors, thus making our generation even less equipped to face an already daunting challenge.

</p><hr>


<p>
Even though I knew that the majority of emissions came from time quite recently, it is still surprising to see just how short of a time was needed to incur devastating effects. It is infuriating. All of our values have been twisted for the sake of patriarchal capitalism and the greediness of only a few. At the core, I do believe humans just want to protect their loved ones and their home, and we feel that connection to every living thing on this planet. However, with the domination of a few people, humanity has turned into a destructive force, gobbling up the Earth’s resources without a thought for anyone else but ourselves. And even as the younger generations cry for help, when they are just not old enough yet to make the decisions themselves, older generations close their eyes and pretend everything is okay. It is absolutely terrifying that this is the reality we live in now, and it makes sense that our generation is angry. Even now, as the facts keep building and the consequences are starting to be witnessed in person, our politicians continue to support the very industries that are destroying us. It is horrifying that only a small percentage of the world’s richest nations have been able to cause this harm for the entire planet. It is not fair, and yet now we have to deal with it.
<br><br>
Maybe humans’ perception of time is to blame, but now we absolutely have to start acting. If our generation can understand what’s happening, then the generations older than us, who are supposed to be smarter, wiser, and more experienced, should be able to do the same. Ken’s apology meant a lot, because I haven’t heard any apology before, and it is incredibly important that our generations come together and act in unison. I really hope we will be able to change our ways fast enough.
</p><hr>

<p>
One theme that I found particularly interesting throughout the lecture was the aspect of cause and effect on carbon emissions and how the massive delay between each led many individuals to undermine the drastic effects on our planet. It reminds me of my own decisions at times and how I will procrastinate on an assignment until the very moment it is due and the most important. Usually I am able to get it done in time for the due date, but that isn’t the case all the time. Similarly, this issue of climate change is not one that we can choose to neglect until the very moment it becomes a decisive factor between our survival as a species. If action is not taken at this very moment, catastrophe may well ensue. I also liked the analogy regarding smoking cigarettes and how if it does not affect us, it certainly affects others. We used to think this at a certain point, until all the effects became known. This is even happening in society today with vaping. Many do not know the repercussions yet and still choose to indulge in it. Ultimately, I believe that the solutions that we as a species must take to ultimately solve anthropogenic climate change are not radical, but necessary.
</p><hr>

<p>
This lecture emphasizes how CO2 emissions have increased dramatically during his lifetime because of his generation. Although his apology is appreciated, I think our generation should feel somewhat responsible as well. I understand that doing something in the moment seems to have little to no effect at the time. His generation did contribute a lot to the high CO2 emissions but there’s so many people like him that are doing something about it. 
<br><br>
I found the way he compares the climate crisis to smoking 5 packs of cigarettes a day interesting because our population is unknowingly harming the planet for themselves and everyone else around them. For it to only take a single lifetime to increase as drastic seems alarming and give more means to act fast in climate justice. 
<br><br>
His solutions are what I found the most important because we cannot allow it to be left to the generation following us.
</p><hr>

<p>
This was a fantastic lecture! Also sparked some pretty angry emotions at Professor Hiltner’s generation. But we can be angry, but more importantly we have to do something. I had learned in a previous class that the rise of ppm of Co2 in the atmosphere was form 280ppm in pre industrial times to 415ppm now. But I love that it was made clear that only in the past 60 years (aka a single lifetime) we rose the level of CO2 by 100ppm! Now I think that dispels any climate change denial argument that this is just a ‘natural variation’ in the Earth. I was partially aware but not fully aware until this video of how the time delay in consequences of climate change was a big reason the generations before mine failed to act to limit emissions. There was no reason to rationally because the consequences were foreseen in the distant future and didn’t happen immediately. This actually goes against our psychology: It is hard for humans to act in a way that will make a distant future better. It is also why only when enough consequences and enough education about the link of the consequences to climate change occur will enough global action be taken to get rid of fossil fuels and anything that causes large amounts of greenhouse emissions (hello, the meat industry). 
<br><br>
Last quarter I took an environmental ethics class, and in this class I learned about the concept of environmental justice. Basically, climate change is a clear case of environmental injustice as shown in the video: the bottom 3 billion people contributed 5% of total emissions while the US alone contributed 25%. Yet the poorest people will suffer the most while they benefited the least from the emission of fossil fuels (which spurred the developed world). This is complete and utter nonsense, so when people ask why the Green New Deal includes social equality and social justice measures alongside climate mitigating actions to be taken, this is exactly why! And the wealthy countries have more resources to mitigate climate change than poorer countries therefore are way less vulnerable to the effects! Huge injustice here.

 I agree with your comment. It truly is crazy how 60 years - a relatively short time in comparison with the existence of our planet - could lead to such a huge difference in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. It's far more concerning how the level of CO2 is continuing to rise still, and could reach a lethal amount. It's unfortunate that the consequences of climate change were not noticed until they started getting very harmful. However, as Ken mentions in his first lecture, "The climate crisis as a generational issue," that that is also the reason why many climate activists are young, like Greta Thunberg. We are angered that the generations before us lived without a threat so deadly, but did a lot to contribute to that threat, which we now have to live with and work to prevent. Additionally, Ken makes a good comment about how it is too late to prevent the mistakes of the past from happening, but there is still time to help the youth, and he encourages everyone to do anything they can to ensure that the planet stays livable for the generations to come. I think that is probably the best form of an apology the youth can expect.
<br><br>
 Also, thank you for your insight on your previous class. I did not know the Green New Deal included social equality and social justice measures, but I am glad to hear that, especially because much of our harmful byproducts end up in countries who barely contribute to climate change. It is so unfair that even when it comes to a global issue that threatens the entire human race, our system favors the wealthy, and forces the poor and innocent to suffer.

In the first lecture video “The climate crisis as a generational issue”, Ben states that the climate crisis caused by his generation of people who gave negative impact on the environment has brought negative influence on the next generation. The second lecture video “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” also points out that for those who live in poverty area who does not contribute to the global warming, they are still suffering from it. It is both unfair for the new generation as well as these poor population to pay for what others have done to the earth. The new generation have enjoyed the convenience that technology bring to them, which means that they do need to be responsible for the greenhouse effect and other climate issues. However, it is extremely unfair for the population who does not consume the modern technology but end up pay off it.
<br><br>
The outcome for greenhouse effects caused by not only carbon dioxide but other gases was not realized by people in the past because of the time delay. People right now realize the importance and seriousness of greenhouse effect and become responsible for it. Even though most people have been told the importance of global warming, some of them still focus on industry and produce more greenhouse gas simply because they want to increase their wealth. On the contrary, I am inspired by Ben who have spent all his lifetime to protect the planet. As a pioneer, he will give the rest of us a great motivation and help us to take all our efforts to protect the environment and climate.

I completely agree on how you said that those who live in poverty don't contribute to the climate crisis, but are still suffering from it and how unfair this is. I also think that it is important to see that even though the generations before us have mostly influenced us in a negative way in regards to the impact of fossil fuels and climate change occurring in the world today, we learn more and more and with this should be able to stop this vicious cycle that is causing the climate crisis. As a college student, I feel pretty knowledgeable
<br><br>
The impact of greenhouse gases was not seen for a very long time because of the time delay, which is very dangerous and has caused the earth to suffer extremely. This is why many politicians still don't see climate change as real and they try to hide the truth from their constituents. But, this will all collide on us one day if we don't do anything about it and if we don't call out these politicians. With more education, especially for the young generations, people will truthfully see what is going on due to fossil fuels and other dangerous acts by humans like deforestation. 
<br><br>
One thing that I remember from both the film "Before the Flood" and the article "The Uninhabitable Earth" is that developing countries and poor countries are suffering a lot more than developed countries when it comes to the climate crisis which I see as completely unfair because the most fossil fuels are burned for consumers in developed countries. Islands in developing areas are being completely destroyed because of rising sea levels and people are dying as they lose their homes. They barely use any sources of electricity or buy any factory-created goods, but have to suffer for our benefit. This sickens me and urges me to want to fix this issue.

“How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime” opened my eyes about how recent this planet’s problem was brought about. The fact that only in the past sixty years the Earth has contained 135 ppm of CO2, while in 1959 it was only at 280 ppm, seriously worries me. CO2 emission into the atmosphere is increasing at an alarming rate. The analogy of smoking cigarettes constantly with no repercussions for me, but only to my family for generations and generations to fossil fuel use showed the ignorance of many of the older generations’ people. When I see politicians actively disregarding the climate change issue and spreading this to different generations and groups of people who then believe that climate change isn’t real, it’s both disheartening and angering. While many of those who don’t believe this problem is real continue to damage the earth, others are working hard to fix the problem. Everyone should have heard about climate change before, but now the task is to make this an immediate problem that requires an immediate solution. If not, the task for the upcoming generations will only become tougher and tougher, up until climate change is irreversible
</p><hr>

<p>
I found it very shocking to learn just how fast these outcomes from utilizing fossil fuels have emerged, that we have done more damage to the planet in the last 60 years than we have done during our entire existence. It baffles me that these effects don't have a more outraged reaction from the general public earlier on in the climate crisis, likely because people want to pass on the blame to others and don't want to make changes to mitigate their individual impact. Even small changes in daily life can have a dramatic effect that can help slow the progression of the climate crisis and bring it under control.
<br><br>
Cigarette smoking is a great analogy that I think many people can easily understand, as the attitude towards smoking has turned a lot more negative once the health effects became widely publicized. I believe that the aspects of our industrialized economy and the negative climate impacts they have could eventually experience the same thing, leading people to be more cautious about how they impact the environment. People like Greta Thunberg are what we need to push people in the right direction and bring the necessary awareness to reverse the damage we have already done.

For the longest time, I have felt proud of being a part of the generation that seems to be the only one to collectively care about our climate. After watching both of Professor Hiltner’s videos, I came to realize that not only does my generation seem to care much more for the climate, but that most of this care stems from anger and resentment of the generations before us. Knowing that a large portion of the most pressing climate issues were brought about in the past 60 years, less than a full human lifetime, is extremely angering. It is also extremely angering to see how few people of the generation that doomed us seem to care or feel apologetic for their actions.
<br><br>
It feels like a heavy weight is on the shoulders of me and my peers. Many members of Generation Z feel that they are the last chance the planet has to survive climate change and reverse its harmful effects, even though we never asked to have this responsibility. However, it is refreshing to know that many of us are willing to take on this responsibility and move into action. Many young adults are the driving force behind the promotion of using reusable items, reducing plastic waste, eating a plant-based diet, and limiting energy and water usage. We are striving to live more sustainable lifestyles, but as mentioned by Professor Hiltner, it is crucial that we practice and teach this lifestyle to generations below us as many of us did not receive such education from our parents.
</p><hr>

<p>
The lecture videos “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” helped me better understand the situation regarding climate change. It is frightening to know that the climate crisis was brought in a single lifetime because it displays that humans can cause a significant effect on the planet in a relatively short amount of time and contributed to an ideological split between two generations. However, it may take more than a lifetime to undo this significant effect because of the severity of the situation today as caused by the delayed impact as mentioned in the second video. It is even more alarming to know that the United States contributed to one-fourth of the carbon dioxide in the world despite consisting only 4% of the world population. It makes me reflect on my choices as a citizen of the United States and how it contributes to the climate crisis.
<br><br>
Although “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” concludes with an apology from the older generation to the younger generation regarding the climate crisis, the older generation should not take all the blame. There exists those in the younger generation, including me, who are also guilty of contributing to the climate crisis because of our ignorance and for that, I also sincerely apologize. I did not seriously consider my carbon footprint before these videos, but I now realized how much I also contributed to the problem through my daily actions. Therefore, I strive to become more conscious of my daily actions and help prevent any more damage done to the environment.
</p><hr>

<p>
Ken was right when he said in the first of these two lecture videos that younger generations are upset we have to clean up the climate crisis caused by older generations. Prior to this video, I was not aware of how recently so much of the damage to our environment occured. It makes sense from a logical point of view considering that we made more technological advancements in more recent years that would require large amounts of fossil fuels to be burned (cars were invented in 1885, for example). I’m struggling to understand, though, how older generations were able to contribute so much to the crisis in such a small amount of time. Plus, as Ken said, many people from these older generations haven’t changed their bad environmental habits. Thus while our younger generation struggles to repair problems they didn’t create, older individuals are continuing to delay our progress. The longer it takes for us to clean up the environmental mess, more and more subsequent generations will have to feel the impacts. 
<br><br>
One point from the video that made me very angry was the fact that the poorest 3 billion people in our population hardly contributed to carbon dioxide emissions, yet they will suffer the consequences harder than many of us at UCSB will. Developed countries will have mechanisms to protect ourselves from some of the repercussions of climate change for a while, but many of the poorer people in our population will not. This is quite obviously an extremely unfair scenario. Those who created the problem, and arguably continue to fuel it, will not be the ones impacted first. Subjecting innocent people to problems they have little means to defend themselves against is cruel.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching this video, it came apparent to me of how acute the situation is we are dealing with today. However, it makes sense that this happened so suddenly, as it is all because of the delayed reaction of the effect from the influx of greenhouse gasses. 
<br><br>
An example that can (somewhat) correlate to the climate crisis’ ‘delayed reaction’ we are dealing with today is the recent e-vape incidents that were put into the spotlight from last year. In the past decades, e-vapes in the US entered the market to be an alternative to smoking tobacco products, as they can inflict health issues. At first, e-vapes were praised and hailed to be helping the population get over smoking. However, as years went by, the youth population in the US started to use these products, as companies failed to realize that they can be very addictive. Later, many cases of dangerous sickness were proven to be caused by some vaping products, as they had a delayed reaction by being used constantly.
</p><hr>

<p>
“How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” was a very shocking and eye-opening video regarding the climate crisis, the appalling reality of the pace at which it emerged, and the magnitude of consequences that our generation is slowly coming to recognize. It was very interesting to learn about the time delay that occurs before any natural human consequences are felt, and how this delay made way for an intergenerational split regarding the reality and severity of the climate crisis at hand. Hiltner effectively displays how the climate crisis is an enduring generational issue, using cigarettes as a universally relatable analogy to identify the horrible consequences that our children might face if we fail to recognize them ourselves. Just as cigarettes can severely impact its consumer, they also will affect those who surround the consumer (along with the generation that follows it), the fossil fuel industry has done exactly that but on a consequential scale in which no human will be able to eventually escape. 
<br><br>
Since 1959 (the same year in which Hiltner was born), Carbon Dioxide levels in our atmosphere have risen by 100 ppm, with ¾ of all the C02 in the atmosphere being emitted since that same year. Hiltner continues to point out that the United States alone has contributed ¼ of the world’s carbon emissions despite having only 4% of the world’s population. What comes next is a disgusting and almost unbelievable fact: In comparison to the U.S. and other major carbon emitters (Europe, China, Russia, etc.) the poorest 3 billion people on the planet contribute only 5% of emissions. Staggering. From these facts alone we can come to the conclusion that the poorest people and the least developed countries will face the brunt of most of the negative environmental consequences, despite contributing the least for us to get to this point over the last generation. It is sad to think that this is the main possibility and still, so many are lobbying for the continued exploitation and expansion of the fossil fuel and oil industries. I definitely want to learn about solutions to these seemingly generational issues.
</p><hr>

<p>
I’ve never been one to think deeply about the specifics of the life of my future family, but Ken’s words snapped me into the reality that our human actions are propelling us into irreversible damage. He acknowledges that if we continue on the self-destructive path of fervent consumerism and pumping fossil fuel emissions, we are not only ruining our own impeding futures, but also the ones of the generations who come after us. This epitome made me extremely upset because what does our lasting damage speak about who we are as people? Are we that selfish and greedy, that we do not care about whoever picks up the pieces, as long as we’re fulfilled? Personally, I am not fulfilled despite the materialistic life I, and many Americans, have been privileged to grow up in. I am unfulfilled, because I agree that our reactions are delayed. Social media influencers, authority figures, presidential candidates, and others can preach about the damage we are responsible for, but words are empty at the end of the day. It is time to face the problem head-on and halt the excuses and generational blaming.
Furthermore, this video introduced a startling statistic that positions the accelerating state of climate change destruction in the spotlight: that in the next twenty years, human beings are capable of skyrocketing carbon emissions from 415 to 455 PPM, the largest leap in emissions in human history. This statistic alone proves that the climate crisis has been consistently building up throughout generations and we are at the extreme breaking point. In fact, our planet is already broken, but we have the power to do something about it and not merely witness the decay. I admire Ken’s apology on behalf of his generation and wish that more people his age would acknowledge their equal roles in fueling the fire. However, it is also important for my generation to analyze our own consumption powers and accept our role as well.

“The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” illustrates the behavior that people did and are still doing to destroying the earth. Professor did a great job of using the metaphors to explain the damage of the delayed effects of CO2. He uses second-hand smoke as an example to illustrates the time delay, which makes us think about our future and the subsequent generation’s future. There will be a significant time delay before the consequences are felt. You would suffer none of the consequences of your actions, but your children and every subsequent generation of your descendants for hundreds of years would suffer them all. The CO2 in the atmosphere is still increasing and we need to stop those people who are causing the damage to the earth. 
<br><br>
I totally agree with the professor that most people on the planet are did nothing contribute to our planet, some even keep destroying the earth. I think we need to let people have the consciousness of protecting the environment. We cannot let the world suffer those consequences, so we must take action now.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching these two videos, I have a strong sense of feeling that the climate crisis was a generational issue. If our generation still do not get a clear perspective of what we are hoping to do with our planet and continue to overlook the past experience, the next few generations will suffer more serious problems than we did. People should shoulder the responsibility for ensuring that their families, friends, and relatives do have an awareness of the climate crisis. We should not only consider ourselves's interest and profit, but also our son, even grandson. They will suffer from numerous problems if we still do not treat this matter seriously. I like the example of smoking cigratte in this lecture. It strongly demonstrates that how our behaviors affect our next generation. A strong sense of awareness is the cornerstone of achieving the goal successfully. Also, governments and people need to strike a balance between the industrial economy and our planet. Developed countries such as the United States and Russia have a blooming economy. However, they are also the two countries that emitted most CO2 into our atmosphere which indirectly influence those people who have not contributed that much to the atmosphere. A host of poor countries are being afflicted with chronic effects from excessive amount of CO2. It is kind of unjust for them, and we should be inclined to pay attention to this problem and try to solve it.
</p><hr>

<p>
In the first week lecture, what has been said in the video about the “time delay of the consequences” reminds me of something that my father said when I was young. There is a huge chimney near my home. In the winter, there are lots of smoke coming out of the chimney. My father used to stare at it and say to me: “Sometimes I cannot imagine what kind of world you will be living in when you grow up. I used to play and run under a blue sky.” I cannot understand what he was saying at that moment. A few years after, my high school always canceled the PE classes, even all the classes sometimes, because the air condition didn’t allow us to go outside. Though now china has largely managed this problem, I have seen and deeply understand what an unsustainable living style could do to the environment, and eventually influence us. 
<br><br>
When professor Hiltner mentioned “the first fossil fuel economy emerged 400 hundred years ago,” It makes me relate to a historical event that respiratory disease become the second leading cause of death after the plague in 1667. Also when professor Hiltner mentioned the year 1959, that’s only a few years that the polluted air has killed over 4000 people in 1952. The impact of over-using fossil fuels has already been written in history for people to learn. I think that it is important to come up with some solutions and changes so that the tragedies will not happen to the next generation.
</p><hr>

<p>
"How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" does a great job of demonstrating and acknowledging how this issue has developed in only a short amount of time. I completely agree that the issue has had many delays in efforts to prevent further climate change and this is principally because of politicians and big corporations with money and political power. Naomi Oreskes, author of "Merchants of Doubt" does a wonderful job of explaining how the issue of climate change turned into a debate and a bipartisan issue after numerous scientists claimed it to be an important and pressing problem. In her book, she highlights how a select group of scientists with ulterior motives, many supported by the fossil fuel companies, raised issues within the subject of climate change. Their claims, often not scientifically proven challenged what 97% of other scientists had agreed upon, causing the public (many of whom did not realize it was only a small select group) to question was what right. These scientists main focus was not to say climate change was not happening but to challenge scientific data and cause delay within the government on action towards preventing further climate change. I think that the delay we see today on the issue of climate change has roots stemming from private corporate interests and the politicians who depend upon their support. Although I believe we need federal action from governments globally, I think that the new generations are rising up and using our voice to promote the change we want to see. Our activism may start locally, but hopefully it will have global impacts.

<p>
The video “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about a single lifetime” both discuss how previous generations have laid the foundations for current and upcoming issues facing the world today. The climate crisis is the cause of a persistent problem, because there may be an immediate effect, it will urge our world to take action to develop a solution to this crisis, rather than ignore it, because the consequences are not immediately felt, and It is happening slowly and why it keeps becoming less obvious.
<br><br>
Through the cigarette analogy, he consequences are easy to deal with, because these people do not see or may not see the consequences of their actions. Even if it doesn't always affect you directly at first, the long-term impact will catch up with you and it will be disastrous. It's a lot like climate change. Since the impact has come, no one is worried, now they deny it.
<br><br>
I hope that our generation will be the one to stop the increase in carbon dioxide emissions and the generation that will actually make this world a better world for future generations.

I want to start from the 2nd lecture: how the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime. The fact that the most severe harm done to the earth is made by the last generation and the majority is still alive, repeating the same activities, is harsh. There are specifically two points that arouse my interests. The first one is the use of analogy. Ken likening the consequences of smoking to harming the environment. In his bold imagination, he asks what if the climate injustice left to our offspring is the consequence of smoking. Through the small but powerful analogy, the audience can effectively get the seriousness of what they have done. The other thing I want to mention is the time delay. I was always wondering why people, though have the environmental problems in mind, still did nothing. Ken’s perspective inspires me. “This was largely because of an unusual time delay that challenges and confuses our ordinary temporal perception of cause and effect.” Just as the example he mentioned in the video, emitting tons of CO2 performs nearly inconceivable harm to the atmosphere when compared to pouring oil into the ocean. The perfect contrast suddenly shocked me and made me realize there are always pollution and harm. They happen not just all of a sudden. 
The first lecture is about the young environmental movement. The young generations are fighting for their own rights toward a clean and protected environment, and there’s no way for me to forget the environmental protest happening last year in Santa Barbara. Also, students at UCSB hold a sign-up table regularly near the library in order to gather support from us. They should not be ignored and instead, encouraged.

  I really liked the way you organized your comment to transition from discussing the second lecture to the first!
 <br><br>
  Ken states how the solutions that he plans on further outlining in the video may seem “radical,” but are they really? It is ignorant to describe any solutions regarding the climate crisis as alarmist or extreme, and I completely agree with you; the smoking analogy really spoke to me as well. It is incredibly frightening to imagine replacing our fossil fuel addiction, otherwise known as the cause of human-induced climate change, with tobacco pollution. By comparing the two ideas, Ken took a seemingly impossible situation and connected it to a harsh reality.
  <br><br>
The youth movement is also worth mentioning. Ken’s apology to the younger generation- the generation that is obligated to clean up the ecological mess that the older generation has forsaken to us- speaks volumes about the baby boomers who are actually willing to take into accountability the disregard shown towards the climate crisis’ existence, let alone its graveness. However, since there is an increasing amount of awareness being raised within the youth community, positive change is much more achievable than it has ever been in the past.

The video “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” discusses how previous generations have started and contributed to the dangers in the world we live in terms of climate change and the disastrous effects it can have. I learned that our emissions have been exponentially increasing and if we don’t do something about it soon, we will just be worsening the planet for us and future generations. The video mentions that during the climate crisis there is a significant delay before the effects are felt. I believe this to be extremely accurate and why most people don’t really think of climate change as such a big deal as it actually is. If there were immediate effects, people would be more inclined to act on it because they would be able to feel the earth and their lifestyles worsening. The ppm has increased by 1/3 in the past 60 years, and at an exponential rate it would be life-threatening to live in a world like that in 2079. These innovations for development in the last century will harm our future descendants for hundreds of years.
<br><br>
I greatly appreciate Ken’s apology for what his generation has done to expedite climate change and the disastrous effects in the future. He takes the blame for his generation’s mistakes, but it is mainly due to large corporations that prioritize money over the well-being of the planet. I hope that they will realize their detrimental effects and plan to reduce emissions and significantly mitigate and even possible stop the rate of climate change and the climate crisis we are in.
</p><hr>


<p>
In the first lecture video, “The climate crisis as a generational issue," I appreciated the fact that Professor Ken introduced some possible future effects of climate change. Even if we make a move to switch to renewable energy and use solar energy (solar panels), the effects of climate change will still last through many generations to come. There are so many ways, big and small, that we can do to help our earth. Whether it be walking, riding a bike, or taking public transportation to lower our carbon footprint, or even unplugging electric devices that are not in use.
<br><br>
After watching the assigned film and reading the article, I was shocked to think that our earth could potentially be dead within the next hundred years. It is incredible how many people think that climate change is not a real thing are not doing anything to fix this problem that we created ourselves. It is extraordinary how much carbon cows produce and water they use up. If people would stop eating so much red meat and switch to being vegetarian or even just eating poultry, it would eliminate quite a bit of the carbon emitted and help with droughts. As of right now, climate change is seen on such a small scale that not a lot of people care about it, but sooner or later it is going to affect people on a more personal level to the point where people will not be able to turn their head and ignore the fact that they are now affected by this horrible outcome we have made and contributed to.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching both lecture videos by professor Ken, I really enjoyed the way in which he presented how the impacts of climate change will affect our planet. My understanding was that the amount of Co2 and other greenhouse gases will be accumulated over time, getting worse and worse. This delayed impact makes many try to deny the issue of climate change, but it is certainly happening and we should expect the worse to happen on future generations. 
<br><br>
I especially enjoyed the analogy made about smoking in that, it provides a clear-cut example of what is happening right now with the climate crisis. Much like a person smoking, expecting no sort of impact or effect to happen to them, this would instead harm and contribute problems to their future kids and generations. Ken points out that this same idea is happening right now with people from his generation in that they denied for many years any sort of climate change issues but don’t realize, as they ignore the problem, it doesn’t stop any effects from happening on future generations.
</p><hr>

<p>
While watching “The climate crisis as a generational issue,” I thought that it makes sense that the youth are concerned more so than the older generation because they are the ones who will have to live with the consequences. But then the catch-phrase to take action “for our children” confused me because why then is the older generation still not stepping up, even if climate change may not hurt them but indeed for their children? I think that the anger that the youth have for the older generation is a good thing for the cause, because anger is one of those special emotions that make people act. While becoming depressed about our current predicament may make one depressed and inactive, this anger is causing people to want to fight, and become exceedingly passionate about the topic.
</p><hr>

<p>
“The climate crisis as a generational issue” brings to light about how the delayed impact of the climate crisis allowed for this last generation of humans to push aside the issue for the majority of their lives as something irrelevant. The lack of action taken to search for solutions in the last 60 years showed me how much of a problem climate change has shaped up to be. My experience firsthand with the generational divide concerning our outlook on the situation has been mostly positive, as the older figures in my life have generally been optimistic about the future. 
<br><br>
I know that statistics like the ⅛ people continuously living their daily lives harming the planet and the 100 point increase in Carbon Dioxide PPM can be frustrating to learn about, but I am beginning to be more conscious of my habits as a result. What really impacted me was the fact about how the wealth disparity between developed countries and others will shield us for the time being, but generations of less fortunate nations are in for a very bleak future if action isn’t immediately taken. I’m a bit curious as to what the radical solution Ken will propose for us to take, but am also looking forward to see ways in which I can have a positive impact on this issue.

<p>
In the lecture, “How climate crisis brought about in a single lifetime,” I especially liked the part where Ken Hiltner stated how it is not too late to react. In my opinion, a video or written speech about how we have damaged the Earth to a point of no return does more harm than good. There is time to fix the mess than humans have created! If “there is nothing that we can do,” humans will not try to reverse the damage that has been done. They might even cause more damage! I especially loved the part where “only a few people have to smoke cigarettes in a terrible amount for the entire next generation to feel the effects. This goes hand in hand with climate change as the rich and powerful countries cause the most harm to the planet (the United States contributes for ¼ of CO2 emissions) but the entire planet has to feel the consequences.
</p><hr>

<p>
From the lecture, I can feel a kind of hopeless from the professor even the video is only about 10 minutes. Since professor’s generation seems doing nothing but continuing to damage the earth. I can see that the hope towards next generation as us, the one can do something to the environment. As the climate is getting worse, the fast we act, the better the climate will be. Because we all know the consequences that made by decades ago, when people did not take the climate change as a significant case and burn the fossil fuel even more in the later years. 
<br><br>
The fossil fuel is one of the reasons causing the global warming for sure. The releasing co2 to the atmosphere have major raising in several decades to 415 ppm in 2019. That is pretty shocking. People always did not admit their own fault until showing the evidence. And the result for last generation’s carelessness causes on the younger generation as me and us. So, instead of the cycle passes to the next generation again, we should do whatever we can right now.
</p><hr>

<p>
I find it appalling that generations before my own have taken such little action against the climate crisis. I feel like we have been tasked with solving the greatest problem of human history resisting our own self-imposed extinction. The time delay of the climate crisis is unfortunate, but the rate of progress of the crisis is increasing as factors multiply each other as more and more pollutants enter our atmosphere. Every subsequent generation will face exponentially greater consequences as the world grows more populated and consumption increases. The scary statistics Ken shares in lecture prove just how exponentially the problems climate change create are increasing, with carbon ppm that will soon become unsustainable. Another statistic that is particularly bothersome is that the the poorest people who only contribute 5% of the CO2 in the atmosphere face the most worst effects. 
<br><br>
Our generation and future generations have no choice but to face the challenges ahead of climate change and the battle against it. We must reduce our consumption and find ways to reverse the polluted content of our atmosphere so civilization can go on.
</p><hr>

<p>
In the video “how the climate crisis was brought about in a single life time”, the professor talk about what people did would destroy the environment. As we all know, what people do today would not affect immediately on the environment today but would cause damage maybe several decade in the future. People could not only think about themselves now but should also care about the future, which I think is the responsibility to do. With the rapid development of modern society, it would definitely have some negative influences on environment since some technology have to develop. Although it is impossible to have no bad damage on our environment, however, we could do something to make it no t become so terrible. People should all work together to protect our environment and make the future generation to have a better life. Doing something more but insist for a long time would definitely have some positive effect on our environment.
</p><hr>

<p>
I felt sad when I saw the video and learned from the lecture saying that there are humans who deny the existence of climate change. From my personal observation, I have noticed that the climate nowadays is much more unstable compared to the past. The summer is getting hotter and the winter is getting hotter too. It is harder to see snow in my hometown now where there should be snow in the winter. I believe climate change does exist and it has brought influence on the earth. As ken states in the video, people might not notice the fact that the negative consequences of CO2 emissions might take a long period to occur, so we might have an idea that the CO2 we emit now is fine and does not cause any problems. Then, we will not change our lifestyle and keep hurting the earth with large amount of CO2. However, the actions we take now do bring effects on the earth, maybe the bad impacts will take time to appear, but it will happen someday and bring bigger problems to our next generations. After hearing this idea, I changed my idea. I used to have this idea that I am a small individual, what I did is too trivial to bring an influence to the earth, so I do not even have the idea to start a green lifestyle. But now I know, the cumulation of every individual’s little damage to the earth can be fatal damage to the earth, so I decide whatever others do, I will do my part to save the earth.
</p><hr>

<p>
These two lecture videos work together to help us better visualize the dark reality of what we are currently living through. Professor Hiltner explains that the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime, and proves his point by pointing at the numbers that show the dramatic and surprising increase of CO2 in the atmosphere. As difficult as it is to accept yet not to understand, we must realize that in past decades, the climate problem was ignored, worsening its effects on us today. 
With that being understood, we can only expect conditions on Earth to be worse in future decades due to the amount of CO2 being released into the atmosphere at this point in time. 
<br><br>
Professor Hiltner describes the climate crisis as a generational issue, which is a perfect description to give. Not only are younger generations continuously contributing to the climate crisis, but these actions are creating effects that are set to affect future generations, some which are not even born yet. 
As touched upon in the video "The climate crisis as a generational issue", the rebellion against our recklessness is driven in part by concern for children who are yet to be born, such as children of the current teens taking this course. Being a teen girl with a goal in mind for my future, it is not rare or weird to get asked about my plans to have children and start a family. However, whenever I give my answer about how I do not plan on having children, older people often laugh and say things like "Just wait until you get older". Sometimes I want to respond with "I will just wait for you to become educated on the reasoning behind my answer", but I simply let it go. However, in future occasions I plan on defending and explaining my reasoning behind not having children to not only bring more awareness to the population issue but also to the climate crisis we are living through. 
<br><br>
I was most intrigued when the topic of time delay was mentioned and explained. Time delay can be one major contributing factor to the climate crisis, as Professor Hiltner points out. He explains that if and as CO2 is released into the atmosphere, it is trapped for hundreds if not thousands of years, which is as long as its toxic consequences are able to last. 
This fact is a difficult one to come to terms with, especially taking into consideration future generations. Not only is the current population rising at an overwhelming rate, but the climate crisis is not the only factor that can jeopardize survival on Earth. I now understand why the climate crisis is a big problem and how it will continue to be one for years to come. I remember being younger and learning about a future technological world ran by computers and flying cars, but I have long forgotten about that. Not that it is not possible anymore, but it is no longer in my thoughts or even in my imagination, since our current lives revolve around the issues that these industries cause. The fact that there are only three countries that are responsible for almost 2/3rds of the CO2 in the atmosphere is often discouraging when thinking about positive change because they are aiming at becoming more powerful and influential. However, as Ken mentioned in his first lecture, we must open our eyes and mind to the importance of having our voices be heard and implemented. Which is why we should all take part in the climate crisis movement as well as vote for representatives who will work and fight to combat the climate issue for generations to come.

This was a great video and it really helped simplify such a complex problem! The example with the drops of oil piling up into the well and eventually, but slowly, building up was a great way to understand how generation after generation knew about the climate crisis and never really took it as a serious threat. Another part I found striking was at 9:35 which shows the contrast between us and developing countries. I get angered when I think about what we're doing but moreso, how it is affecting developing countries who, compared to the US, are contributing to the climate crisis in pretty small amounts. I think it is exciting to see what the younger generation is doing and how passionate they feel about the climate crisis. While the silence of previous generations is mind-boggling, we can't let that distract us from how amazing current-day popularity around this subject is becoming and the generation's passion to act. I don't think the older generation has ever felt so inspired and it's because of the urgent pleas of the generations to come that will likely have to deal with the aftermath. After watching this video, I am really excited to continue watching these short lectures from Ken!
</p><hr>

<p>
To start off my response to this lecture video, I would just like to comment on the smoking analogy made by Professor Hiltner. There is so much validity in this example, mostly because it seems as though the people chiefly to blame for the climate crisis (big business people such as those in the oil, clothing and food industries) seem to simply turn a blind eye- both because they are greedy and because they simply don't care, because chances are there won't be any complications in their lifetime. However- what about their kids? What about their grandkids? It is astonishing to me how ignorant and frankly disgusting people can act because of money.
<br><br>
I would also like to comment on the fact that the US is responsible for the vast majority of Co2 emissions, even though we only make up 4% of the worlds population. On the other hand, poor countries have barely contributed. I was not aware of this statistic and it honestly blew my mind. It makes me ashamed to live in the US.
<br><br>
Overall, what makes me so angry, both before I watched this lecture video and even more after, is the level of greed. What good is money if there is no earth to make it on? I will continue to be baffled by those who are so capable of making ginormous changes but refuse because it will cost them money.

<p>
The key word for this YouTube video might be—lifetime. Indeed, how could climate crisis happen in a single lifetime? That’s what we all would question about. We might have all thought that even if climate change is true, it’s something that takes place over the period of several centuries, but Professor Hiltner showed us that’s maybe not the truth. In the video, he stressed the year of 1959. Why is it important? It is his birthday. Even if we don’t know about others, we can see that we have done to the earth on the lifespan so far of our professor. Just in his lifetime, the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere has risen for about 100 ppm. That is, about one thirds of the total level before his birth. Also, with the current life expectancy, the concentration seems like would keep increasing to a level of maybe 445 ppm, which is a scary figure. This is why climate crisis could be brought to us in a single lifetime. 
 <br><br>
 Meanwhile, I agree with our professor that his generation, along with our generation, should have sincere apologies for our children. The truth is, we are consuming so much fossil fuels and we suck at protecting our environment. But that’s also why we should take actions now, because we still can do something to save our planet, even just y a little bit.

<p>
The video "How atmosphere emergency realized in a solitary lifetime" was stunning. I imagine that the video that presents how the atmosphere emergency is a generational issue and how the fault can generally be put on my parents age group as the ones who have left my gen. a planet that isn't inviting and one that is in genuine peril of getting much progressively harmed because of environmental change. Despite the fact that I see how my parents gen. are in the wide degree, more answerable for the atmosphere emergency than my age, I imagine that we have to assume liability for our activities and acknowledge how we additionally legitimately add to environmental change through our ordinary activities and buying in to cultural standards that will in general maltreatment the earth.
<br><br>
For me, the most interesting part was when Ken referenced that a fourth of all the CO2 put in the air was from the US. This is baffling being my nation, while I had understood that it was primarily brought about by people, the way that a quarter was America is marvelous. While the least fortunate level of individuals on the planet contributed just 5%. With this data out for people in general, it astounds me that these enormous nations like the US, Russia, and China, have not accomplished more to help spare the planet. In view of the effect of these nations, everybody on the planet is enduring. The video "The atmosphere emergency as a generational issue" was the principal piece in this class to give me trust. While yes, it is uncalled for and disappointing how past age has left the earth in this condition to us, the way that individuals my age are teaching themselves, and battling and requesting for a change is rousing. The more individuals are informed the better possibility we have for a change while it isn't past the point of no return.
</p><hr>

<p>
In “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” Ken mentions that the climate crisis was not slowly caused over centuries or many generations in a single lifetime, which is to say the past few decades. Pondering this reality is shocking because as a STEM major, particularly one taking evolutionary biology, I’m taught to think about phenomena of global change as occurring over the course of countless years and generations. In fact, part of what makes it so hard to gather information on ecology and evolutionary biology is that what is being studied occurs over far too long a time span to be studied by an individual or group, even if they devoted all their lives to the research. So what happened in the past few decades? How did we get to the point where we caused irreparable damage to a planet that thrived for over a billion of years within a single lifetime? 
<br><br>
I also completely agree with Ken when he says that over half of the people living on the planet have done nothing to contribute to the climate crisis. In fact, I don’t really agree with the term Anthropocene to describe climate change and would instead favor the term Capitalocene. I think the Great Acceleration circa the 1960s and the prioritization of economic growth and capitalism is perhaps the biggest culprit and contributor to the climate crisis. Even today, Trump would rather deny that climate change exists and favor immediate economic growth over a long term plan to address the immediate problem that will continue to wreak havoc on the planet. At the end of the day, we caused the problem and it is rightfully our responsibility to deal with the consequences and restore what we can.
</p><hr>

<p>
While watching this lecture, I found myself reflecting on how I have contributed to the climate crisis. Within American capitalism, it is impossible to not have a carbon footprint; however, there are tangible ways to reduce it. I have spent so much time and energy being angry at the generation before me for their inaction and ambivalence towards the climate crisis, but I have not taken much time to reflect on what I have negatively contributed. Even though my criticism and the criticism of my generation is entirely justified, we cannot be discouraged by the damage that has already been done or turn a blind eye to the repercussions of our individual actions. I hope that from this course, I will not only learn of a larger proposed solution, but also of the ways individuals can reduce their carbon footprint.

  It's always interesting trying to balance criticism for the previous generation and each taking individual responsibility. We were all raised in a consumeristic, environmentally degrading culture, and it takes a lot of work to unlearn the ways of living that we've adapted. With such a previous lack of education considering environmental issues, it's hard to know if we really would have done anything different if we had grown up with the same absence of awareness. I think what really matters is simply accepting that the damage is done and moving forward with widespread aggressive action to counteract the problem. It's important to take responsibility for your actions, but it's not going to change anything unless we adopt a coherent culture that can complement the environment positively.
  <br><br><hr><br>
  I completely agree with you. While the previous generation did essentially jump-start the climate catastrophe, it's  equally as important to reflect on our own impact as consumers and residents of the number one CO2 contributing country in the world. I too, feel angry about the state that the world is in, and how we've been left to pick up the pieces. But as Ken said, he often wonders how his generation will go down in history, I know that we will forever be known as the ones who saved the planet. Ken's generation made many mistakes, all of which we can learn from. If such as disastrous contamination of the planet was essentially created in a single lifetime, then I believe that it can be solved in one.

The youth movement being emphasized as an initiative to improve and expand upon gives some hope and provides a less pessimistic vantage point of the issue of climate change. However, I feel more angered at the previous generations for not realizing and acting sooner against this, seeing that the physical evidence became much more obvious at a faster rate. It is shocking to compare the statistics of carbon emissions from different time periods and noticing how accumulation has encountered an exponential pattern. Perspective is also seen as a contributor to the current climate, specifically with reference to time. Delaying and postponing has been an all too common course of action with an issue as delicate as climate. Politics are to blame for much of this, as some politicians and their strategies are based on the large corporations that endorse them. Essentially, the only way to secure these sponsors is to adhere to the principles, fundamentals, and beliefs they hold. The differentiation of the developed and underdeveloped worlds shows the distribution of the technological advancements and other inventions from hydraulic fracking to coal plants to manufacturing factories that place a significant dent in the amount of carbon emissions the atmosphere holds. Considering all of these variables, there is no doubt that there is much to do. It is difficult to defeat, especially counting in the power dynamic of corporations and collective causes. However, the people that sparked the climate change crisis are still alive today and hold the key to recovery, as long as the youth are open minded to their perspectives and are willing to be creative in crafting solutions for reaching the objective of a better planet.

In the first lecture video, “The climate crisis as a generational issue," I appreciated the fact that Ken brought up future effects of climate change. Even though we take action now and switch to renewable energy, the effects of climate change still last through generations and Ken's second video, “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” does an amazing job illustrating that point. I really liked his analogy using the cigarette scenario because it made the information easier to imagine and process. Through this analogy, we can see the weight of the effects of climate change and how it affects our future children and grandchildren. Ken additionally pointed out how poverty plays a role in this mess. It is heartbreaking knowing that those who did not even contribute to our CO2 emissions will be affected and those who did contribute the most will barely even recognize the problem.
<br><br>
I respect Ken's apology as not many people will admit to their own faults. It's a bit frustrating knowing that previous generations couldn't or didn't want to acknowledge their cause of climate change before. But there's nothing you can do about the past. What's done is done and the only we can do is to move forward with protecting our planet. I do feel a sense of hope though because I see how older generations and younger generations working together to shed light on this issue. The world could really use more people like the protesters in the first video and people like Ken.

I agree that the cigarette scenario made the effects of the climate crisis easier to understand . I also thought that it brought great awareness to the many ways it is affecting the people on our planet; it is very heartbreaking to see that those who had no contribution are the most affected. 
<br><br>
I have realized , that there are people today like Ken, that have began to notice and express their concern for the issue. As you mentioned, we see many generations coming together today in protests. I hope that others, including ourselves, begin to take action and gain knowledge on the importance of the issue! 
 <br><br><hr><br>
Given the severity of the issue, I can't help but wonder what will be Ken's proposed solution. It seems as if the only viable way to survive would be to completely cut off carbon emissions today. You mentioned that we need more people like the protestors from the first video.  Do you think that they would be willing to essentially cut off all their carbon emissions? They are clearly willing to act, but I am doubtful that we as a society are prepared for such a change. With solar and renewable energy improvements, I am certain that we will eventually be able to have the same lifestyle without the burning of fossil fuels, but I fear that it will happen too late. I think that if we were to completely cut off fossil fuels from our lives, there will have to be a transitional period where electricity is only available for essentials such as communication and food but not necessarily personal transportation. 
<br><br>
Expanding on the cigarette analogy, one of the main reasons cigarette smoking rates dropped was because of the hefty federal and state taxes that got put in place. I think that this analogy ties in nicely with the Carbon tax we saw last week in DiCaprio's movie. In order to force action, we need to put a carbon tax in place and help to spread the word. I think it is sad that we (California) consider ourselves a very green state, where we brag about our vegan movements, companies such as Tesla, and some of our environmental policies, but where it really counts, putting a global tax on carbon products, we have failed to take action.  </span>

After watching this video, I was shocked by the human impact on the climate. The professor's metaphor is very vivid and thought-provoking. People's impact on the climate is like a person smoking, and the effects on his body may not be immediately apparent, but future generations will pay for it and suffer from it every day. Such a statement would allow many people to begin to think about the impact humans now have on climate, because it is about the health and well-being of their offspring, not just themselves. 
<br><br>
The professor concludes by noting that the world's rich countries, with a small population of natural gas and oil, have produced the most carbon dioxide emissions. It's unfair that the rest of the planet even all life is harmed for carbon dioxide not emitted by itself. The professor's final apology was also so thought-provoking that people began to wonder if their generation did too much harm to the climate.

When watching this lecture I found it crazy that the rise in CO2 that has caused concern and climate change has just happened in one lifetime. This lecture makes me think why, why has nothing been done to stop this until recently, why do some people deny it when it has been proven by science that the world is changing and it is because of humans. With that said, what I find astonishing is the people that are contributing to it the most. A very small percent of the world's population including us is the biggest contributor while the other 3 billion people have only contributed 5%. I find this really sad because the 3 billion people are the people that will and have seen the worst of climate change. This is not how we should be caring for other people or the world. Even when we are not seeing the direct effects of climate change it is important to remember and realize there are and going to be people that see worse. Additionally, I think that the anger from younger generations is understandable and will make sure that they do not follow what the previous generation has done. They will demand change.

This weeks two lecture videos brought up many points that I honestly never thought about. For one, I did not realize that it actually does take time to see the effects. Im assuming this would go both ways, so the actions were taking to reverse this will be seen in a few years. Ken also brought up the scenario of smoking cigarettes having a consequence only on your kids. Cigarettes, as we know, are also very addictive. If we look to the generation that caused this, most of them have still not changed there ways because what they are doing and have done has become a habit. I appreciate Ken’s apology, but until his generation cares about the younger ones, we are the ones who will have to save our planet. Another point, though, is that the United States is privileged and I know before this year I did not see climate change as a crisis. By being privileged most of the US may feel like it will not affect them (or at least I did), so in order to truly cause a change we need to start caring about others.

This lecture “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” resonated with me because we have known about the impacts of CO2 in the atmosphere and the subsequent climate change for decades however, we have done minimal things to reduce our fossil fuel addiction. What captured my attention the most in this lecture is the fact that the amount of CO2 we are emitting is growing exponentially, even though we have created many other ways of creating energy since the industrial revolution we are still mainly using fossil fuels, we are even finding more dangerous ways of extracting it rather than using alternative ways of producing energy. What is most terrifying is that in the next generation we could be putting in more CO2 emissions into the atmosphere than in the entire human history. As Hiltner pointed out the people suffering the biggest consequences of our actions will be the future generations. I loved the analogy of tobacco use, no parent would smoke tobacco if they knew their children would be the ones suffering the health consequences, therefore why are we continuing to damage our planet and put our future generations at risk of deadly droughts, storms and other natural disasters as a result of our consequences.

The most striking part of these two videos by Ken was when he introduced the smoking analogy, it is a devastating comparison. In the case of climate change, it is as if the planet itself is smoking five packs a day. Every organism who lives on this planet is being affected by the pollution in the air. The planet itself smoking would not have been so catastrophic if its lungs were also not being damaged. The amazon rainforest, the lungs of the planet, is being clear-cropped for livestock production -- which will only add more methane to the atmosphere. It is a cyclical path of destruction that is solely being caused by humans. The impact of decades worth of pollution is finally taking its toll on the planet that we reside on. It is great to see that the generations before us are acknowledging the mistakes that were made during their time, however, no single person has caused this; it is purely a societal issue that has been creeping up on us. We just didn't turn around to see the dust in the wake of industrialization. 
<br><br>
The reason why governments did not take a serious step towards fighting climate change was because there was no backlash from the environment. This is not the case though anymore, the environment is rebelling against all of the pollutants wreaking havoc on its residents. It is finally time that we turned around and confronted the mess we have made as a species.

I definitely agree with you, Ken's analogy of smoking was very hard-hitting and eye-opening. I also can really appreciate the way you brought the comparison all the way back to the start in regards to our planet's CO2 emissions literally being the same as smoking five packs a day, not just in the metaphorical sense. I also wholly agree with the belief that yes, while the Boomer generation may have been the start of these great spikes in CO2 emissions, it's not as though everyone else isn't at fault either. Ken's apology was greatly appreciated, but it really isn't just one person's fault, this is a global crisis. The last line of your first paragraph, "We just didn't turn around to see the dust in the wake of industrialization," is such a great way of putting it. Your final points on the governments not acting because there was clear causation is true, yet it's pretty unfathomable that even now when we're seeing the destruction before our eyes higher-ups are still refusing the acknowledge the problem.

In older and past generations, the effects of burning fossil fuels were an “out of sight, out of mind,” issue. Only in recent years as the onset of global climate change has led to extreme weather events, heightened sea levels, overburdened infrastructures, and the spread of tropical diseases have these issues become visible. As discussed in the video lectures, the burden of these effects has become anything but equally distributed. Many of the luxuries enabled by unsustainable industries and burning fossil fuels that have contributed to global climate change such as fast fashion, planned obsolescence by tech industries, and single-use plastics, are enjoyed by the affluent/wealthy few and the detriments felt by the disadvantaged many. 
<br><br>
Climate change has become the biggest threat to human health and quality of life, especially for those already disproportionately burdened by poverty and (or) environmental racism.  In moving forward, addressing climate change with attention to equity and social justice would establish protections for the most vulnerable groups, continue to assist those who aren’t, and allow us to pass down a habitable earth to future generations.

I agree with Marian. The idea of burning of fossil fuels was reckless for humans to not see as a future issue. I mean scientists have already detected climate change a hundred years ago but as evolution in the human race and advancing of technology, it blinded the future of our generation. As much as we love to see society thrive in every discovery possible we should have, and need to limit the resources of our actions. It's crazy that we started caring about this problem when extreme weather patterns like hurricanes and heat waves started happening. Like did we not do the science to predict this?  I feel so devasted to hear that people in poor countries and are in poverty will be affected the most. Knowing that they have nowhere near the tools like cellphones, television, and cars as a middle-class human, truly sadden me. We are the reason they will suffer the most

It was interesting to hear about how most of the effects that we are seeing today are due to the actions that were taken in a single lifetime. In addition, the smoking cigarettes analogy worked very well in explaining how everyone else gets affected by your own actions. It was also disappointing to hear that the poorest 3 billion people only contributed to 5% of the carbon dioxide emissions whereas the US, Russia, and Europe contributed most of it, and is only 1/8th of the world population. Also, those 3 billion people who really did nothing to contribute to climate change will be the ones who feel the consequences the most. This is truly heartbreaking to hear. People are just out trying to live their lives and we are over here making the world a harder place for them to survive in because of our own selfish needs. Hiltner shares how he is ashamed of what his generation has done to the world and tells the audience that we can count on him in helping turn this situation around, and that is greatly appreciated.
  </p><hr>

<p>
After watching the “How the climate crisis was brought about a single lifetime”, my eyes were opened to the idea that aspects of our world have the possibility of changing dramatically in a very short period of time, whether it be a positive or, in this case, a negative change. This being said, after one week of introduction to the climate crisis it came to my attention of where the world currently is and where it's headed; however, I believe if we work together and truly want this world to be a better place then it too can be done in a lifetime. 
<br><br>
This video and the past weeks’ lectures have been very inspiring to me that I do want the “cigarette metaphor” to come to an end. Prior to watching this video, I didn’t exactly understand that the climate crisis occurred over just a span of a lifetime; but, when the cigarette metaphor was used it opened my eyes to how this world truly is and how it originated from our country, the U.S. This truly saddens me and urged me to do even more for those who truly need it. As a country, we need to work together to not allow anyone else to suffer from our wrongdoings.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching these two videos it has made me so sad to see how much damage the country I call home is doing to the world. Not only is the U.S damaging itself it’s also damaging the poorer country’s who only make up about 5% of the CO2 being admitted. That’s insane, especially since the poorer countries are being the most sustainable but getting hit the hardest. It is nice to see that the younger generations are realizing this and holding strikes and rallies against carbon emissions but most older generations aren’t admitting there is a problem. Professor Hiltner said “the people who created this problem are still alive” so that means these people can get rid of the problem too if they tried. More people need to be educated and open minded so we can stop the climate crisis.
</p><hr>

<p>
In high school during my junior an organization aiming to raise awareness in regards to “Global warming” opened the eyes of our entire class, it was then that we found out that the U.S. was in fact the major culprit behind the obscene amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere. Still, it has been even more eye opening and shocking to truly understand that we as a global community have done more environmental harm to the Earth in the past 60 years than we did throughout our entire existence/development prior.
<br><br>
I feel that the U.S.’s policymakers are definitely controlled by Big oil, gas, etc to continually exploit the natural resources, the American people, and the American dream. Our overconsumption, large living, shallow feelings, and disregard for Brown and Black communities worldwide is appalling and shameful of us. The Republic’s leaders are more occupied in selling out themselves for dead presidents rather than to live up to their duties to the planet and the people. I really enjoyed and acknowledge Ken’s sentiments in his apology for his generation’s impact on the younger generations future. My generation and the generation that will be coming after are the one that will have to suffer and feel the most for the greed and close-minded goals of the old.
<br><br>
It is definitely a complex and heavy topic as we are all complicit in the avarice of it all. We care deeply about the environment and such but we care more about upholding the large standard of living we have become accustomed to in this modern era. Making the impact of the Oil and Gas moguls and failures of our leaders is the first step. I believe we can move forward with the next step by electing the right leaders such as Bernie Sanders.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching the two videos by Professor Hiltner, I am left with a slightly angrier approach to this issue than I previously had. My generation has every right to resent the ones before us for creating such a situation for us to then have to fix. The points that were made about the way that American's, who contribute a staggering amount to this issue, live their lives is what I have said for so long. While there are simple changes to one's everyday life that can help this issue, such as switching your diet or switching to more environmentally friendly ways of transportation, it's not practical for most Americans and most couldn't imagine living their lives without meat or without the ability to fly from place to place. I hope Professor Hiltner's apology on behalf of the generation to our generation makes people think twice about the things that they are doing and the way that it is impacting the future. 
<br><br>
The sad reality of the situation is that most people will not take action and refuse to acknowledge the problem until the actual consequences come for them. The analogy regarding the use of the cigarettes should spell out for people that, even though it wasn't always directly effecting you in the beginning, the long term effects will catch up with you, and they will be catastrophic. This is much like the issue of climate change. Since the effects come after, nobody was as concerned, and now they're in denial. 
<br><br>
I am hopeful that our generation will be the one to stop the rising of the CO2 output, and will become the generation that actually will make this world a better place for the future generations.
</p><hr>

<p>
I appreciate that Ken acknowledged and apologized for the damage done to the planet by his generation. I’ve always been frustrated at the fact that older generations left behind such a damaged planet, but never acknowledge the fact that they did so. In many ways, it feels like I’m in a store where someone else breaks an expensive item, but I have to pay for it. Although this is an upsetting reality, it is the one we live in. I’m not sure that we will succeed in meeting our climate goals within the next few years. However, I have faith and hope that our generation, and the generations after us have the courage and desire to try, because we are able to see and learn from humanity’s past mistakes.
<br><br>
Something that I think is important to do, is to keep the line of communication open and clear between the young and old generations. Like Ken said, many people from older generations who contributed massively to climate change are still alive, and will likely live for at least 20 more years. In my opinion, it is not too late for them to learn new things, and change aspects of their life to live more sustainably. I believe that many older generations are deaf to the topic of the climate crisis, because they feel attacked and blamed by younger people. Obviously, no one would appreciate this, and it is my hope that through open talks and education, older generations will decide to alter their lifestyles. No matter how small the contribution, at least it is a step forward in a progressive direction.

<p>
“The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” combine together and tells the audience a lot about bad and uncontrollable things which human has already done to affect the climate. However, although so many mistakes have been made, it is never to late to start over. The US and Russia have done so many things that hurt the environment without realizing it. If people cannot start some small changes, our next generations will pay for all the mistakes people have made these days. Second-hand smoke is a good example to explain all the scenes. 
<br><br>
I totally agree with all he says in the video, and I feel really sad to see all the badness people and human beings have done to the earth. It is still fine to change the current situation right away, and leave a bright future for the next generations.

</p><hr>

<p>
“The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” shares with me a message about the crisis of climate change to the future. The carbon emission and global warming we caused today will enduring affect our generations. In the future, these problems might be worse and harder to solve. The videos makes me to be clear about the current situation. I believe more helpful I am towards the environment now, less people suffer in the future. 
<br><br>
The planet would be better if human beings, animals, plants, and all living things live together nicely. The best way to reach a balance is to follow the planet's original circumstance: the emitted carbon dioxide can be absorbed by the planet naturally and used by photosynthesis. I thought we should start to put in some actions and do not only focus on realizing how bad the climate will be in the future. Sooner we start, less cost we will receive.
</p><hr>

<p>
As surprised as I was to hear that most CO2 emissions come from wealthier countries like the US and China, but after as the video continued it made more and more sense why. Like with money, there is a small percent of the population that is benefiting from our planet's destruction at the expense of another, similar to how billionaires hoard their vast amount of wealth while the larger population suffers in poverty. It is downright inhumane to live with the greedy tunnel vision that these enemies to the environment have adopted in their day to day lifestyles, opting to watch the world burn than risk losing their status and fortune. To me this alludes to the greater issue of monetary value equating to social status, where the people who really run the show are the elite, and those destroying our planet now are either already a member of this exclusive society or desperately trying to claw their way there. 
<br><br>
The fact is that until these people stop viewing the planet as one big ATM machine, we are always going to be fighting the climate crisis in ways that won't show themselves for another decade or so due to the prolonged cause and effect Ken describes in this video. We can barely make solutions for the rising temperature, floods, fires, and other natural disasters, and if these big businesses and corrupt CEO's continue to plague our planet for their own benefit, we will never be able to create real change. The Carbon Tax, the abolition of fracking, and laws protecting wildlife must be put in place if we are ever going to solve this issue.
</p><hr>

<p>
I found this lecture an interesting follow-up to "The Uninhabitable Earth." The analogies about cigarette smoking reminded me of Wallace-Wells' claim that many people struggle to comprehend the severity of environmental degradation and climate change because of how abstract it could seem with the large and small numbers that feel intangible. Posing cigarettes as a metaphor for environmental degradation personalized the issue for me and made it easier for me to wrap my head around what the numbers that we often referenced in class truly meant. Personally, I've seen many people justify environmentally harmful behaviors by shrugging them off as irrelevant in the larger scheme of things. After watching this video, I understand more how harmful and illogical that behavior can be; if a climate crisis can be fully produced to such a severe state in just a single lifetime, surely our single actions also have negative impacts that add up and compound into issues like the ones we face today. 
<br><br>
I also found it shocking that these are just results of the mitigated effects of atmospheric carbon. Even though we are at an unreasonably high level of CO2 in the atmosphere, large amounts of this have also been absorbed by the ocean. Thus, we see not only the overt effects of human actions in terms of atmospheric CO2, but also see the underlying and implied impacts it has on marine environments as well.
</p><hr>

<p>
I find it crazy how this much damage has been done in such a short period of time. It really blew my mind to hear the fact about the rise in CO2 since 1959. Whats even more crazy to think of is the idea that we are still producing CO2 at an alarming rate and many still ignore this fact. Im very thankful to be growing up in a generation where people are starting to take action and protest this relentless use of fossil fuels because if my generation continued in the footsteps of the generation above us we would most likely eliminate life on earth. This video really made me think of my generations impact and especially my own personal impact. Even though my generation is still young we have contributed to a lot of the damage that has been done so far. I personally, like many of my classmates, am guilty of this as well. However, the actions that I didn't think were threatening a week ago are now recognized for the damage they do to our environment. 
<br><br>
In addition to this, I found it terribly sad and selfish that the United States has backed out of the Paris agreement. Being a country that produces a quarter of all the CO2 emissions I find that horribly selfish. The United States is recking havoc on the environment and whats sad is that the people who have almost nothing to do with this problem are the ones that are going to receive the most consequences. 
<br><br>
Lastly, I fully agree that the delayed consequences are the reason that this problem has reached the point it i at now. We are lucky that the consequences weren't delayed even longer and that we are able to already see the damage that has been caused. If consequences were delayed even longer who knows where earth would be in a century from now.

<p>
In the lecture “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, Professor Ken Hiltner pointed out the relevant proof and solution of climate crisis, as well as the time delay of climate change. According to Professor Hiltner, the core to the solution of the climate crisis that we are currently overcoming is to be radical. This is true as the number one thing we can do to anthropogenic climate change, instead of developing renewable energy, is to change our diet. Under the potential threat of over population, changing the main area of diet from meat to plant may play a great role in resolving global warming because raising up cows releases a load of methane gas.
<br><br>
Creatively speaking, time delay of the consequences of the climate crisis, from my own opinion, is one of the explanations of the inaction of human beings. Because of the fact that the global temperature has not risen as fast as predicted, some of the countries chose to ineffectively implement the Paris Agreement. From my opinion, some climate change deniers and skeptics are promoting that climate changes is not existed as the temperature now is not rising too rapidly. They are denying this scientific fact to ensure their share of interest.
</p><hr>

<p>
Something that Hiltner brought up in his video that was also discussed in “Before the Flood” was how many people in the developed countries want to act as if every person on the planet has to equally share the consequences as well as come up with a solution to the climate crisis when in all reality its the developed nations that need to take the biggest steps as well as find the most advanced solution to combat climate change. It is also mind-boggling that in the span of a human life people have emitted most of the CO2 into the atmosphere than when we first started using fossil fuels. I also find it difficult that much of those same people are not letting the newer generations vote to implement new laws as a way to reverse what that generation had done to our planet because of their obsession with fossil fuels. 
<br><br>
After finishing this video I am hopeful that people like Hiltner are helping to educate the newer generations and the public so we can all convince our politicians that it is time to start to turn away from a fossil fuel-run world and start investing in renewable resources and greener technology.
</p><hr>

<p>
Before taking this course I often felt worried about my own future with the current state of the planet. After reading and listening to information about our reality, I sometimes feel like it doesn't matter what I do anyway. A lot of this damage was done way before I was even born and it will be way worse for the people to come after me. The worst part of it is that the countries that contribute the least suffer the consequences of climate change the most. Hearing that the U.S. only represents 4 percent and yet we put a quarter of CO2 into the atmosphere made me angry. At this point most of the population, especially these big companies, know the destruction they are doing.The proof has been shown in the extended number of natural disasters, endangered species, etc.
<br><br>
Like Ken said in "The climate crisis as a generational issue", the new generation are making changes by using activism but how much does that really help compared to the large amounts of fossil fuels being dug up and released?The new generation, including myself, are doing what we can as individuals to help a dying Earth. I find it admirable that this campus and the people on it take measures to help out as we need all that we can get. However, it is frustrating that the people with the biggest influence do are the quietest.The smoking analogy used in "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" accurately depicted our life as the decedents who are facing the consequences.These two videos posted by Ken makes me worried because if so much damage was done in one lifetime what does the next one have in store?
</p><hr>

<p>
By watching "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime", it really helps you see in detail how this 5th mass extinction were going through worldwide was brought upon in a single lifetime. It helps to see how the climate crisis is really a generational issue. As stated in the video, the youth is rebelling because of the sense of unfairness that we feel because of the actions of our past generation. For the past few decades, people all over the world have been saying that something had to be done in order to stop CO2 from quickly being released at high rates into our atmosphere, but nothing was ever done. 
<br><br>
As part of the youth, I can say that it isn't fair that this is now our generation's problem and we must quickly take action in order to stop massive destruction around the world. It isn't fair that some people who caused the problem still support the fossil fuel industry. For example, many politicians still argue that we should continue to burn fossil fuels. They say that it isn't affecting our world as much as they say. As said in the video, they spend billions of dollars convincing the targeted audience that the world isn't changing. The important thing is that as you stated, we still have time to take action and fix this massive problem. It is important to note that as you stated, CO2 has risen 100 points in the last 60 years. We need to take immediate action to stop the alarming CO2 release and need all the help we can get.
</p><hr>

<p>
In “How the Climate Crisis was bought about in a single lifetime”, Ken talks about how the majority of carbon emissions on earth have been from the past 70-ish years, mostly from the boomer generation. I find it a little unfair to generalize all the mistakes to an entire generation when, from my understanding, the main perpetrators are the greedy ones on top. Previous generations had a mere fraction of the knowledge or resources we’ve had to combat this problem. 
<br><br>
I believe this mindset is unhealthy cause it will cause a “ defeatist” mentality where people will just attribute all their problems to their parents while not doing anything to combat the actual issue itself. As much as I am compelled to say “ok boomer” to the entire generation, it’s not like they’re all out to kill us (just most of the popular, old ones are). Instead of complaining, we should make action and save the world. I believe, until the issue is fixed, we are just as responsible for the degradation of our planet as any previous generation was.
</p><hr>

<p>
This lecture video made me realize how westerners truly revolve the world around themselves. Seeing that the poorest 3 BILLION people of the world have done so little to harm our environment makes you understand why the change needs to begin in the west. We can’t expect every person in the world to “make a change” when they are not the ones who have been drastically negatively impacting the environment.
<br><br>
The fact that the climate crisis was brought on by just a single lifetime still blows my mind. I don’t exactly blame the older generation but I hope they would take responsibility for their actions. I understand that all these new technologies were coming about and they didn’t exactly know the repercussions of their actions, but the older generation shouldn’t undermine their impact on the environment. Instead they should support everything that the newer generations are trying to do in order to change the world.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching the video, I had a strong feeling that I should take action about the climate crisis, even everyone should take action about it. Even though the impact of greenhouse gases is already significant on the environment, I still think humans should deal with it before everything is too late. Just as Ken said, we should think about our children. Nobody will want their children to live on a planet that is full of pollution and environmental issues. We should not only consider ourselves but also think about our offsprings.
</p><hr>

<p>
In this video, I was very alarmed at how much of a lasting issue climate change is, I really like how Ken compared it to smoking cigarettes and how while it might not impact you, future generations will face the consequences. It really puts into context how much of an effect we have on the world and its climate, and if we do not do anything to fix it, the world is doomed. A good note is that it is possible to reverse our actions and save the world from climate disaster, but action is needed now rather than waiting for things to get much much worse. I think that many of us don't realize the individual impact we have, thinking that someone else will do it for us. Instead individuals need to act now and fast if we are to preserve the world for future generations.
</p><hr>

<p>
“The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue” and “How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime” were both hard-hitting lectures, particularly because they highlighted the grave injustices of the climate crisis. The first of these, as described by Ken, is the fact that this crisis was mainly caused by countries that are home to just 1/8th of the world’s entire population. However, not only do the actions of these countries affect the whole world, they affect countries that had no significant contribution to this crisis more than anyone else. While countries such as the U.S. and Russia are the primary cause of climate change, they also have the means to protect themselves better than poorer third world countries. Similarly, the second of these injustices is that the generation that caused the climate crisis is likely to be largely unaffected by the severity of their actions. Instead, their children, and the generations to come, will have to deal with all of the consequences. 
<br><br>
In both cases, the people who will be the most devastated by the effects of the climate crisis had no say in their futures. People with power and money were able to make decisions that will have lasting negative impacts around the world and for years to come. As a member of one of the generations affected, I especially resonated with what Ken said about people my age being angry that the generations before us let it come to this. It is especially frustrating that the same people who caused this are the same ones who are still in power and continuing to make poor choices that will harm their children and grandchildren. We can only hope that they will soon change their ways and help us move towards a better future.
</p><hr>

<p>
Wow, it really is mind-boggling how much of an impact the United States and Europe have made on carbon dioxide emissions in the last 61 years.  Although I am utterly disgusted that the US has vastly contributed to raising CO2's PPM to 415, it hurts me, even more, knowing that the negative effects of pumping these gases into the atmosphere fall onto the shoulders of poor, developing countries who, per capita, contribute almost nothing in comparison to US citizens. This reality clearly shows me how the economic imbalance across the globe has so many unjust effects outside of wealth. As an individual in the United States, it upsets me that so many people here fail to make an effort in reducing their carbon footprint, given that they, unlike many people in developing countries, have learned ways to live in order to take care of the Earth for future generations. It is vital that we teach the youth in the US to not imitate the lifestyles most of their parents have lived so that, as a country, we can emerge as an influential leader in fighting climate change in a worldwide battle.
<br>
I think a valuable and effective way to instill the importance of the climate crisis and fighting it to children would be implementing requirements for teachers in public schools to teach children about climate change and more importantly how to fight it. Like a language or religion, instilling ideas into the minds of young people will persist as their lifetime advances. I wish I had learned about climate change and ways to live more environmentally friendly at a younger age because I could have made positive changes to my lifestyle that I began making only in the last few years. That being said, if I have children of my own I will encourage them to make choices that favor our planet rather than tradition, regardless of public schools' actions. I do believe that because of the general growing popularity of the subject of climate change more people are making changes; however, that rate needs to increase so that it can be seen as the #1 priority. for people worldwide since this crisis is indeed an international issue.
</p><hr>

<p>
I was shocked after watching "How the climate crises was brought about in a single lifetime" due to how Ken mentioned that many of those who live in a lifetime period, can have very different lives. Such as those who cause all the devastation of climate change aren't necessary those who feel the effects of said climate change. The rapid production in the United States lead to us contributing to about 1/4 of the CO2 in the atmosphere. The lack of response of past generations, and those who refuse to help and educate others on the effects of our own personal needs is nothing short of disappointing.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching this video, I learned that the CO2 in the atmosphere has already increased from 280 PPM from years ago to 415 PPM. This shocked me because PPM has increased at a rate so fast that it was not predicted. Ken used the smoking example to show that even if not everyone in the world was smoking and only a few are, those people still risk affecting the Earth for everyone else. Currently, there are smoking devices that say it is a healthier alternative to actual cigarettes but they are also polluting the air, which then increases the PPM value. This made me realized how significant one person’s action is if they want to affect the Earth’s climate. Within one generation, the PPM increased more than three times than in the past century and the ocean is trying to help by absorbing as much CO2 as it can but it can only do so much for the Earth if the people aren’t helping with their actions. 
<br><br>
In the video, it shows statistics of how America, Europe, and Russia contributed to 66% of the CO2 that was released in the atmosphere. This shows how we, Americans, have been polluting way too much and need to reduce the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere so that the generation after us could live on the same planet. If we do not stop emission, the generation after us will barely have a place to live because Earth will become an unliveable planet. It makes sense to me that the previous generation and this generation has the highest PPM value because most of the fossil fuel and oil companies started to expand during this generation. It makes me sad to see that Earth has become a place where all the resources are nearly exploited and can barely hang on before climate change becomes worse than it already is.

I agree that the rise in atmospheric CO2 shocks me every time I hear it.  It is almost unbelievable that it could have risen from 280 to 415 PPM in such a short time frame.  It also happened so quickly that scientists couldn’t even predict how the rate would change.  Now that we have an estimate, it is even more dire that we slow this down if not simply for the reason we cannot plead ignorance anymore.  I also agree that the smoking analogy was a terrific way for people to visualize just how much their actions affect others.  
<br><br>
 Ken’s statement about how three nations account for 2/3 of carbon emissions also shocks me.  Unfortunately, our people won’t feel as many of the first effects as those of poorer nations will.  It is a twisted form of irony, those who contributed less to the issue are being punished more.  America, as well as other nations, need to take responsibility for our actions and begin to seriously cut back our emissions.  Unfortunately, I don’t believe a vast amount of Americans will take climate change seriously until it begins to impact their everyday lives.  When that happens, many lives will have been ruined. </span>

In the lecture “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, we are told about how the massive threat of climate change has been brought upon us in such a short amount of time. The majority of the increase in the world's carbon ppm has been in the past 60 years with no sign of slowing down. If we do not recognize the problem on a mass scale and enforce the 1/8th of the world responsible for the majority of climate change there will be no going back. As being someone who has been born into a world and generation where we are suffering from the previous generations carelessness I view climate change as an important issue.
<br><br>
I liked the analogy with cigarettes and the people responsible for climate change. It is often that the ones most responsible for the trouble of the planet never experience the plagues they brought forth. It is understandable how we still do not change our ways, because we experience no consequences but those in third world countries will suffer the most which is the absolute definition of climate injustice.

<p>
The video “How the Climate Crisis Was Brought About in a Single Lifetime”, Professor Hiltner addresses the huge impact on generation brought upon Earth. It was mind boggling to think that only one generation (of which many are still alive today) released  over 100 ppm CO2 into the atmosphere, and continue to do so. As Professor Hiltner mentioned in this video, the same generation that caused this is still alive, still continuing with their deadly habits, and still raising the children and grandchildren that will continue to take over this earth and damage it. This video was very insightful and suggests we do the opposite that our grandparents did. It is unfortunate that the older generation placed a huge burden on future generations, but it is now time for this generation and the upcoming ones to take immediate action.
</p><hr>

<p>
I wanted to start off my comment by saying how much I respect and appreciate Ken and other members of the older generations, specifically the Boomer generation, who actively speak out against climate change inaction and advocate for doing all we possibly can as humans to combat, in my view, the greatest threat of our times. If someone had told me before I watched this video that the current climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime, I would’ve been inclined to believe them, but not totally sure. Now that I have watched this video and listened to the data and details supporting that fact, I am bewildered and awed, in a bad way, that the state of our planet could be altered so radically just by human actions. 
<br><br>
I definitely thought that the smoker analogy used by Ken was particularly powerful and effective. It can really open one’s eyes to the reality and the gravity of the situation, that situation being the harsh climate catastrophe that our planet is already in the process of undergoing. 
<br><br>
I knew before that the United States and other parts of the developed world such as Europe contributed unproportionally more to the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, when Ken put it into perspective of the US, Europe, and Russia accounting for roughly 2/3 of carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere, it absolutely blew my mind. I think that this definitely is, perhaps not wholly but at the very least in part, a class issue. I believe that the rich, and more specifically those with power in the fossil fuel industry and the agricultural industry are most to blame for the current climate crisis. I wholeheartedly believe that legislation such as the Green New Deal, which I think should include imposing necessary tough regulations upon these industries, is one of the most effective things the United States would be able to do to try and slow down climate change. Obviously it will take a global effort, with the human species collectively working together, to save us from the disastrous ramifications of this catastrophe. 
<br><br>
I have hope in my generation: Generation Z, and the preceding one, the Millenial Generation. I believe the youth of the world have the collective power to stop climate change, and maybe one day in the future find a way to somehow reverse the damage that has been unleashed onto our planet. I have this hope because I know that around the world, young people are finally beginning to take matters into our own hands; because the alternative would spell calamity for the human race.

I really enjoyed reading your response to Ken’s lecture videos and find myself agreeing with many of the points you made. As you mentioned, I definitely appreciate the advocating of people from older generations when it comes to climate change. Rather than letting the problem that they have contributed to fester and leaving it to future generations, many individuals such as Ken himself dedicate so much of their time to educating us about what is to come if we do not take immediate action.
<br><br>
I also really appreciated how Ken put the severity of climate change into perspective with the lecture video titled “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” because it is definitely alarming to think about how in his lifetime alone, the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere rose by 100 PPM, and the rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide is increasing is continuing to grow. I am afraid to imagine what the amount will be in ten, twenty years from now if we do not take action. The cigarette analogy was also incredibly helpful in understanding why a significant amount of people deny or oppose climate change. Just because the effects are delayed does not mean that climate change does not exist or that humans do not have an impact on it. If more people understood that, I think there would be less of a debate on whether or not climate change exists, but rather how it can be stopped.  
<br><br>
I admire and share your optimism for our generation and the one before us, and I definitely agree that there is a considerable amount of people from these generations who are determined to bring an end to climate change. It gives me hope for our future because I feel that if I want to take part in that fight, there will be an ever-growing amount of people who will stand beside me. It also brings me some comfort that there are people who not only believe in climate change but also are willing to devote their time and energy towards combatting it.
<br><br><hr><br>
I totally agree with your assessment that it is up to our generation (GenZ) to ultimately bring change to the terrible pattern that climate change is following. I am less optimistic than you currently. Until I see a wide systematic change within the government, more research on renewable energy, and systematic changes on the individual scale, I think that our generation is all talk. 
<br><br>
I was also shocked that 1/8th of the world creates ⅔ of the overall pollution. And it is absolutely an environmental justice issue considering the same polluting nations are the ones that will bare the least consequences. Rich nations will be able to implement countermeasures for their citizens, but emerging and poorer nations simply do not have the infrastructure to counter these rises in CO2 ppm. 
<br><br>
Ultimately I agree that it is up to us to counter prior generations activities, but I also believe that our generation is already too accustomed to our consumption habits and we will not see a widespread immediate change like many people are calling for. It is unlikely that meat consumption will be slashed overnight and people will continue to buy new clothes. The tragedy of the commons will play a large part in our failure to adapt and it will be many generations before we will lead fully renewable lifestyles.

"The crisis as a generational issue" illustrates how young people today feel very closely connected to the crisis and want to take action to help the planet for themselves and their children. This current generation of people around the age of college and below, gen z, will we the primary resolvers of this crisis. Many of us in the generation will be entering our adult lives as the climate rests at a critical point. With proper ingenuity, dedication, and commitment to unity the crisis can be solved, we can undo the damage that has been done, even if it seems daunting.
<br><br>
"How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" demonstrates more than anything the inequality at the very core of this crisis. The most developed parts of the world contribute more carbon to the atmosphere the any other group. The use of fossil fuels and fossil fuel driven economy has given the more developed countries a much better ability to mitigate the damage cause by incoming climate change. The least developed countries will face the greater damages, inheriting the brunt of the suffering from a crisis that they did little to cause. It is injustice from any perspective. The speed that the problem has progressed should be great cause for alarm. In the lifetime of Ken as he says most of the damage has been done. It will only take another lifetime before irreversible damage can take place. If this will be resolved it will take an incredible change to our civilization.

This video does a great job explaining the timeline and extent of climate change in viewer-friendly terms. I think one of the greatest challenges we face in solving the climate crisis is properly educating people on how this issue first began. I personally thought, perhaps like many others, that climate change was due to the first industrial activities of man and was an inevitable consequence of a technological revolution. However this video has showed me that nearly all of the CO2 emissions increase has occurred within the last 60 years which really highlights the exponential growth of our destructive behavior. We are now observing the effects of this great CO2 increase over those 60 years and they are very real: increased natural disasters and heat waves. The most alarming aspect is that if we let this growth continue to grow exponentially, we know for a fact that the already terrible consequences that we observe today will be significantly worse in the future. In other terms,  even if we stopped increasing our pollution rate and instead polluted at the current rate, we would have still have terrible consequences in the future.  But we are polluting at an increasingly higher rate which will result in even more noticeable consequences. I also really liked how he highlighted that this pollution is disproportionally created by a small portion of the world population, ie those living in richer countries. This highlights the injustice committed by a few on the many. But looked at optimistically, this means that the new generation of relatively highly educated young people, (inevitable products of richer countries) can vote on issues like this in their home countries and have a large outreach on entire world's pollution.

After watching this lecture video, I was quite astonished by what I have seen. Before watching it, I thought that it was a really long term process of releasing green house gases and carbon dioxide. However, it is really surprising that just a generation of people can release such great among of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This make me further realize that it is necessary to take action immediately to save the environment and save ourselves. As we all know, it is a really long process for the carbon dioxide to become fossil fuel under the ground and do no harm to the environment any more, but to release those gas is incredibly easy and quick. Just as what professor said in the video, the green house gas released by only one generation can do harm to several generations later. 
 <br><br>
 
I think the most important thing now is to inform more and more people in the world, especially those who are in the industry of producing green house gases like carbon dioxide the harm of doing all these things. Letting them aware that releasing such among of carbon dioxide can greatly do harm to their offsprings. In my mind, one of the most important reason why people do not protect the environment and keep releasing green house gas is that they do not really realize the disadvantage of it and how serious can the problem be. Thus, in form them and educate them can be really important.

Before watching your video, "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime", I didn't know how exponential the detrimental effects were on the earth. The two factors that you mentioned, there is a significant time delay until the effects are felt and how these factors are still continuing makes me worry significantly more about the future. Even if our generation and politicians somehow turn around and stop what we are doing to the Earth, we will still be feeling the effects for years and years to come. I completely resonated with your comments about the significant time delay. It made me question about whether or not any of our generations would have averted this catastrophe. Even though it doesn't mean much now, it wasn't the problem with the generation, it was a problem with the way our species thinks. We are a species of instant gratification and often times if it isn't directly affecting us then we don't care. And hopefully we can somehow find a way to avert this problem, I'm looking forward to your future lectures on how we could do this.

<p>
The lecture videos, “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” really dive into how although the causes of climate change have been accumulating for the past 400 years, the worse of it has only been in the last lifetime. Professor Hiltner describes that three-fourths of the total carbon emissions have happened since he was born 60 year years ago. He expresses his sadness and shame for his careless generation that did not do enough to slow the effects of climate change since most actions did not involve an immediate reaction which left many believing that what they were doing was not, in fact, all that bad. We now know, however, that the actions of the past generation will affect/harm every future generation from now on. The analogy he used to describe this was if one person smoked cigarettes their entire life with no consequences to their health, but their children and grandchild and any other descendant would have to live with cancers and lung issues, or any other smoking-related illness for their entire life starting at birth. I think this was a perfect way to describe the climate crisis. We are the first generation that will most likely not get to live better lives than their parents, and that's a scary thought.

I really enjoyed this particular lecture video because it was clear that Ken was addressing the younger and future generations in a way that was simply concerned and informative rather than condescending. There are many who believe that the current generation is exaggerating the true gravity of climate change right now. There were things that were explained that made the issue at hand incredibly transparent and with this is showed what danger we are and have been facing for decades. With pure undeniable facts on his side, Ken was able to present the issue of climate change as something worth looking at and working to fix. 
<br><br>
What I appreciated the most was Ken acknowledging the role that his generation and past generations have played in speeding up the horrendous effects of climate change on the earth and the general public. He addressed that it’s more than grossly unfair how the U.S, who is usually portrayed as a grand economic kingdom, is able to get away with being responsible for the majority of CO2 emissions yet those who are innocent are also suffering at the hands of the mistakes of the United States. The closing apology served to reinforce Ken’s true passion for this issue and showed to viewers that our generation, while we may not have worsened or even created this issue, have the ability to speak out, learn, and hopefully reverse enough of the effects to save our planet.
</p><hr>

<p>
This lecture opened my eyes of how newer generations will suffer such consequences due to climate change. I never realized how much damage of years humans can cause to the earth’s atmosphere. This video paints the harsh reality of outcomes due to climate change, I especially enjoyed the example used to call most older generations out on the destruction they have caused so far. If we were to not endure the consequence of smoking, that would seem like a great outcome, the only catch is that the next generations to come will have to endure all the consequences of lung cancer and respiratory diseases all because we chose to ignore the issue and disregard any consequences. Many choose to not address the issue because they don’t want to face the damage they have already inflicted, they don’t want to admit that they were wrong to begin with. It’s a sad reality especially since most of our wildlife and sea creatures are the ones who suffer the most. The only thing we could do now is have a more optimistic view on our future in getting involved to reverse the damages or save whatever that has been left behind.

Look, this is a hard subject to listen to, to think about. I know that a large portion of my generation is hopeless and angry, because we've been tasked with literally saving the world, and we're trying even now, and there are still those making it even worse. I feel that too sometimes. Honestly, fairly often. But, I think this idea of it only being a lifetime's worth of mess that we need to clean up is an important one. It's a hard to grasp one. How could all these awful things be from one-eighth of the world and one generation? I have lived my entire life in the heart of the climate crisis. I can't imagine life without it. But, if I believe in anyone, I believe in the youth of today. The older generation was not purposely destroying the planet, but we will purposely heal it. We are strong-willed and ready to take action. HIstory has had millions of injustices that lasted several generations and were stopped by one. If any generation can fix our world, it's this one. The issue is dealing with those who still harm our planet more and more every day. I try not to look at the climate crisis as a generational divide, but a class divide. It is the greedy and the powerful that spread falsities and rape the earth. These ultra-powerful are also raising their kids to do the exact same. We can't expect the world just to be changed because the old are dying out. We need to fight for it.

<p>
In the video above, Ken emphasizes the disproportionate impact of the few upon the many. The examples provided include people separated by time and people separated by wealth. The United States, which houses just 4% of the population, contributes about a quarter  of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. By contrast, the poorest half of the world contributes just 5% of the CO2 emissions. Yet, the wealthy people who have the most impact will suffer the least consequences. This disparity brings to light the social injustice inherent to the issue of climate change: those who perpetuate it will suffer the least. We already see this idea in action in places like India, where the poorest cannot afford the equipment necessary for clean air, and tropical islands, where people who have practiced the same behaviors for generations are forced to leave their homes due to flooding. 
<br><br>
I think this idea can help to convince more conservative people of the necessity of dealing with climate change. Here's how: many conservatives do not want to assist people in need (our homeless population, asylum seekers, etc) as long as they are not the ones in need. The number of people in need of assistance is only going to increase the longer we go without responding to the climate crisis. Thus, it is in their best interest to find solutions to climate change in order to reduce the number of climate refugees. The wealthiest among us believe they are above it all, because they have historically solved their problems by throwing money at them. It is also helpful to remember that inevitably, the climate crisis will touch all of us, or our children and grandchildren. There is not enough money in the world to buy a new planet.
</p><hr>

<p>
Of course, I feel I should definitely apologize just like Ken did. I was told about the crisis the globe is facing when I was very young, which means that the notion of protecting the environment has been introduced to me years ago, but I didn’t do anything in reality except verbally “protecting” the Earth. Perhaps it was the society and peers that influence me to stay silent, but I am supposed not to continue being assimilated by an accustomed climate-devastating lifestyle as I grew up. I’m so sad about the Earth and future generations. I totally agree with Ken’s opinion that there is an impact delay that might deceive people’s sight at one time; however, the consequences will ultimately be revealed and harm ourselves. 
<br><br>
What I want to know through these lectures is that what exactly I can do, instead of being a verbal protector. Detailed data and corresponding solutions should all be posted and accessed by the public, including step-by-step instructions and executions on how to react and live sustainably from now on.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching the video “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” I feel impressed by how my previous concepts were reversed by the video. I really like the analogy about the cigarettes and how the number of people being affected outnumbers that of the people who creates these effects. One in eight people who smoke would affect the newborn in the next hundreds of years. What’s more, smoking wasn’t seen as an issue until we discovered the harm it does to the human body. 
<br><br>
All the climate changes are actually brought in by one generation, while it will continuously affect the following generations for a duration longer than we imagined.
<br><br>
It also impressed me that how a small portion of the whole population creates the most amount of greenhouse emissions. However, other people, and many following generations, still suffer from climate change, even though they are not responsible for producing it. Considering the distribution of the amount of greenhouse gas, it’s not fair for all mankind.

<p>
I thought the generational lecture straight into the second lecture created a really strong narrative about the history and current timeline of the climate crisis. The cigarette metaphor struck me deeply and I think could be useful for every human to hear and think about. As the first video presented, we, the youth, are rebelling because of what we’ve been born into with the ways in which our parents failed us and our climate. We don’t have time to wait for someone else to fix it, as these delayed effects, as presented in the lecture, have already begun. To go along with the metaphor our earth is a blackening lung as we know it. I know that many people do not pay attention to the climate crisis as they believe as one person they cant make a difference. This is like continuing to smoke cigarettes each day with the mindset “oh one more won’t make a difference.” It will. Each cigarette, each climate crisis denying person, is damaging our lungs, our earth, just the same. 
<br><br>
If this week’s lecture has done anything, it has convinced me clearly and without a doubt that action needs to be taken and it needs to be taken now.  Even just watching this one 12 minute video I think people could be convinced of the same thing. It is shocking that there are still so many climate change deniers when all of these scientific evidence is not only right at their fingertips online, but also right in front of them every time they step outside. Being in the developed world, having all these privileges, we are doing so much destruction that are strongly affecting the impoverished this very second. If these effects were happening as strongly in the developed world right now I believe we would see more action, but I am saddened that that is what it might take. 
</p><hr>

<p>
The two lectures greatly summarized my thoughts about how the devastating effects of climate change will not be felt by the generations who have caused it but rather the generations after them who have not been adequately prepared or given the resources to counteract this phenomenon in this current time. These older generations were supposed to be protecting us but instead have burdened us to deal with a severe issue that we are not responsible for. Even now, with younger generations finally fighting back with protests and young figures like Greta Thunberg bringing these problems to the general public we continue to be held back by a government filled with selfish individuals from older generations who refuse to take accountability for their actions and allow us to enact change out of pure greed and pride, which does nothing but heighten the issue. 
<br><br>
I really appreciated Professor Hiltner's apology at the end of the second lecture which is something you do not hear much of from older generations but if we are honest it is not the common man like him who is to blame for this problem. It's the billion dollar companies and politicians in office we have today who belittle the youth and have put us in this situation where we demand change but our concerns are denounced as "brainwashing" or "insolence". Even today, while looking at a thread about a recent climate change protest on the news I was dismayed to see that a majority of the comments from boomers were aimed at attacking the protestors by claiming their actions were the sole reasons for climate change such as driving a car to get to the protest rather than seeing the bigger picture having to do with big unregulated companies + lack of policy change. This undermining of our concerns has to be the most frustrating part about this whole ordeal. 
<br><br>
Reading about these issues have really changed my viewpoint for the future. I have always wanted children and a family of my own in the future but at this rate, I honestly don't know if I could morally bring a child into an Earth that will potentially become inhabitable and a dangerous place to live upon in as little as half a century from now. Without change, this will likely become a sad question we will all have to ask ourselves in the coming years.

This also summarized how I felt. I agree with you that even now younger generations are still being held back by the older generations in the government who refuse to listen and take action. It worries me that it likely won’t be until our generation is in charge that real changes will finally be made, and we will be in an even worse place by then. It also scares me how Ken mentioned that the older generations have taught us their same carbon loving ways that will continue to live on in families unless people realize and make changes. 
<br><br>
I too appreciated Ken’s apology as I have never heard a sincere apology on a matter like this before. It frustrates me that while there are people like Ken taking accountability for their generation and trying to education those younger than them, there are still people that still don’t even believe these problems are real.
<br><br>
Your last comment is very interesting and something that I agree our generation will have to seriously consider. I too have always wanted a big family and I now worry that may be a moral dilemma, especially with our planet’s population growth problem. It is definitely something that we will have to really think about.

<br><br><hr><br>
I totally agree that it was unbelievably irresponsible of the older generations to destroy our Earth and leave us to deal with the consequences. Especially when those older generations have still not fully taken responsibility for their careless actions and do not even support our generation in trying to fix what they broke. You mentioned Greta Thunberg - even though she is doing so much to raise awareness for the climate crisis and fight for a better future, she still receives so much backlash from some world leaders and politicians. It is not only that the older generations do not care enough about our planet to stop destroying it, but it also almost seems like they do not want us to save it either. This just shows how little appreciation they have for our Earth and that they just take it for granted.
<br><br>
I really hope that our generation will do a better job of providing a safe and secure future for our children and grandchildren. Sadly, I have to agree with you that I am not sure anymore if I want to bring a child into a world that is on its way to becoming uninhabitable. I definitely do not want my children to have to fix the mess that my generation made, the same way that we now have to save the planet that the older generations have destroyed. Then again, if humans were able to do so much damage in a single lifetime (Ken's lifetime), then it must also be possible to do a lot of good in a lifetime. Maybe we really will be able to stop the climate crisis and try to reverse its effects as well as possible. If not for us, then for future generations that will have to suffer from the consequences that we have created. In a way, it is almost motivating. The past generation did not care enough about our well-being and future to save the planet, so now we can show them how to do it better.
</span> </div><hr>



<p>
My main takeaway from the lecture was how much damage such a small proportion of people could deal. In one sense, the cigarette smoking example emphasizes how the actions of one generation of people can affect so many other people and living things for years to come. Even though so much fewer people have existed in the past century compared to the sum of human population in the future, it is the larger group of people who will suffer if nothing is done. 
<br><br>
However, I believe the cigarette analogy is not completely accurate. Those living in the past few decades have been experiencing the effects, though not as drastically. This only further criticizes those who fail to act in response to climate change, as they are clearly already experiencing some side effects.
<br><br>
Another example of how a small percentage of individuals disproportionately is the economic injustice involved with climate change. I have known that the United States pollutes more per capita than other countries but did not realize it was so unbalanced. With only 4% of the world’s population, we have 6 times the expected contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. With more wealth to combat the effects of climate change, like air conditioning, the US is less affected yet causes an even worse situation for developing countries. 
<br><br>
It is deeply unjust for poorer countries to suffer at the cost of wealthier countries habits. Despite this, our current president outright denies climate change. He has done nothing in leading the United States to becoming a greener country and has only worsened our situation.
<br><br>
I appreciate Ken’s apology and concern for leaving the planet in the condition it is for the future, but I believe this apology pales in comparison to what he has already done for the plan. Educating students at UCSB, as well as others online who can access his course materials is already much more than most people have done to help stop climate change.
</p><hr>

<p>
After reviewing this video it is clear to me the climate crisis in the eyes of many people is a problem that wont affect their lifetime.  Like Ken suggest, his generation was another important factor of CO2 emission, which contributed largely to the problem we have today.  The fact that we have put more than 100ppm of CO2 into the atmosphere in 60 years is preposterous and it would be intuitive to believe there isn't any realistic way to combat the CO2 emission. As we continue to evolve and develop more technology in a world based around fossil fuels, it seems that we stand no chance, unless we use radical action.  Whats worse than this is the fact that entire ecosystems are being thrown out of order because of our actions. The problem is people don't believe that they have the ability to make a difference because it requires a radical change of the way we live. We have grown accustomed to over consuming our resources, taking more than what we really need, and leaving it when it has no use for us. This way of life is bound to hurt the world somehow and we are finally seeing some of the effects. Or more accurately speaking, other parts of the world are starting to experience the effects. The crazy part is that many of this places do not even come close to the amount of CO2 emission that the USA, Europe, and Russia produce. Climate change affects everyone but not everybody contributes to it equally and those who do contribute to it  are mostly people who are not as heavily affected by it.
</p><hr>

<p>
The videos “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “ How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” talk about the previous generations impact on the planet. It is explained in these videos that in just one lifetime, the parts per million (ppm) of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by one hundred points. This is the biggest jump it has ever made in recorded history. The other fact is that the rate CO2 is increasing more than it ever has. The last time the ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere had reached around or current level, was when there was a mass extinction event that wiped out 97% of life on the planet. The other point that Ken brought up is that it only reached such a level because the previous generation of people did not see the effects of it immediately, so the consequence of those actions is that now my generation and the generations after me have to try to fix the planet we call our home.
</p><hr>

<p>
Ken presents a really interesting analogy when he compares the state of the climate crisis to the smoking epidemic that America faced years ago.  It is true that misinformation can be spread around in order to favor companies that benefit off of the downfall of the environment, and the fact that we continue to allow big companies to do so is sickening. Unfortunately, because of how our capitalistic country is run, wealthy companies gain power by profiting off of uneducated masses, allowing them to sacrifice the environment for their own personal gain. It seems that Earth's downfall will be because of the inherent greed of human nature, which is sad because it shows that as a species we failed to preserve the one place where we can safely live.
<br><br>
I was shocked when Ken revealed that in his lifetime, Americans had only multiplied the amount of carbon emissions that are harming the environment. It really put into a realistic scale how quickly we are destroying Earth, and since we have become increasingly reliant on the usage of carbon emissions, it makes me worry what the state of the planet will be once I reach Ken's age. Though our generation is working to correct the faults of the people who came before us, I am not sure it will be enough for future generations to survive in a sustainable manner on Earth.

<p>
Through the first lecture video, we knew that younger generations are protesting for a better and friendly living environment. It is surprising that the generation that didn’t even born at the time where massive pollution was taking place are taking the responsibilities and trying to make the environment better by themselves. This gave us some hope that even though the climate change has been an issue for generation and relatively late for people to deal with, it is still not too late for people to act and make a difference. 
<br><br>
At the second video, the professor demonstrated that the current climate crisis was brought about a life time. According to the data in the video, from 1959 to 2019, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased 100 more. This data astonished me. How could the amount of CO2 in atmosphere has risen so high but within such short period? This is only about sixty years, what will the amount of greenhouse gases be after another hundred years? I cannot help to think about those terrifying consequences of our actions. 
<br><br>
I think it is a perfect example for professor to compare smoking with the climate issue. People cannot always be rational, most of them can only act when their interests are offended, just like most people only quit smoking when they start to feel their body is affected. 
<br><br>
Finally, about the last part where professor apologized for what his generation has done to this environment, I held another different opinion. I think there is no need for the last generation to apologize for anything. I believe there is a trade off between all things, and actually there are some” benefits” as a result of their actions. For example, because of the great emission of CO2, it accelerated the development of technology and the productivity of goods. Therefore this has provided our generation a better and more convenient life than the lives they had before.
</p><hr>


<p>
The videos of “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” how America has greatly contributed into climate change. The us alone has produced the most CO2 due to the burning of fossil fuels. The analogy of cigarettes opens up ones mind and view towards climate change. We are enjoying life right now with not as many consequences but our future generations are going to suffer. They will develop diseases like cancers and heart problems. Everyone and the even the consumers of citrates know that smoking is bad for them this is because media has informed the public of the consequences. Fewer people smoke after knowing the consequence that are caused such as cancers, respiratory problems, and etc. If media like images and consequences would be put out there more and more people would be able to be alarmed and informed of their actions towards climate change.
<br><br>
It breaks my heart when they showed the two pictures of the children. One of them looks hungry and the other one is happy and enjoying life. One of the children has a bottle as a toy and the other one has an actual toy. This represents how the countries that are responsible for climate change are enjoying life and their riches while the poor countries are suffering and are being affected by it. It is never too late there is still hope but as time goes by hope begins to go down. People will begin to act when others act. This world is made of of followers and will do whatever the leader does. Countries need to take charge and act fast before the human population goes extinct.
</p><hr>


<p>
In the lecture “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, given by professor Hiltner, he mentioned that most CO2 in the world is produced by rich countries, which are the developed countries, and poor people only produce no more than 5 percent of CO2 to the world. First, I want to thank professor Hiltner for his honesty in telling the truth to his students, including me. Most developed countries do not admit their actions which caused global warming to become worse. However, professor Hiltner used data to support the fact. Also, rich people in the world always have a better life, which means that the consequences caused by global warming that influence poor people’s life more seriously than rich people. They are taking the consequences that should not belong to them, which is absolutely unfair. Moreover, rich people have not realized the significance of this problem and still try their best to consume the resources from the earth out of control in order to get more wealth.
<br><br>
I really admire that professor Hiltner can stand out to apologize for his generation’s fault. However, from my perspective, I think the most significant actions should be done at the moment isn’t an apology, but finding the solutions. There is an old sentence which said that there is nothing you can do about the past. Since the problems have shown up, no matter the old generation or the young generation should cooperate with each other as soon as possible and solve it before this question becomes worse and lose control. For myself, after watching this video and listening to the lecture given by professor Hiltner, I realized the significance of this problem and the cause of this problem. I may try my best to take some small actions that can reduce the release of carbon dioxide from now on and tell my friends, my parents, my classmates about this issue. As time went on, I believe these small actions taken by a little number of people will accumulate. As the proverb says, many hands make light work.
</p><hr>


<p>
I found this video lecture particularly informative and compelling. Hiltner is very reflective in his theories about how we slipped into this global crisis and why it is so challenging for us as a species to make meaningful changes to avoid the most severe, Wallace-Wells-esk impacts that we face in the not too distant future.
<br><br>
I, like many of my peers, was partial to the cigarettes metaphor. It was a valuable way to bring attention to inter-generational and social impacts of climate change. I often am very frustrated that younger and future generations will bear the consequences of the actions taken by generations before them. Furthermore, it will be those with the least affluence or political voice that will be the most devastated by our changing climate.
<br><br>
Additionally, I found Hiltner’s apology on behalf of his generation very moving and unique. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like that recognizing the inter-generational injustice that comes with climate change. Hopefully I won’t be making a similar apology to the generations that come after me.
</p><hr>


<p>
When Ken said there will be some time before the effects of releasing copious amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere before the effects are felt, I’m reminded why so many people to this day still refuse to see the climate crisis as the dire situation as it is. Those people include world leaders whose decisions can make a tremendous impact on which road we head down: irreversible destruction of the planet or immediate global action. Because the effects are slow to be felt, world leaders with agendas in monetary gain can feed into the wants of corporations who benefit from the lack of environmental regulation by refusing to address the need for more environmentally friendly change. This is dangerous because when countries like the United States that cause the most environmental damage turn a blind eye such by pulling out of global initiatives like the Paris Climate Conference, people will suffer regardless of the work other countries put in. Additionally, I think that part of the reason older generations don’t understand the major consequences of unsustainable human activities is because we have been practicing many of the fossil fuel extractions for centuries, but the exponential increase in this have only been occurring in the past few decades.
</p><hr>


<p>
In the lectures “the climate crisis is a generational issue” and “how the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, I find it interesting that these emphasize how carbon dioxide emissions in the recent lifetime have increased so rapidly that it could surpass the amount of carbon dioxide ever released in human history. It is unimaginable that in such little time the earth could be brought to the brink of irreversible destruction. In addition, I find it alarming that a large number of the generation that caused this issue still does not believe climate change is an important subject matter that needs immediate action, despite all the evidence of the extreme weather patterns and disappearing life on earth. 
<br><br>
I also found it interesting that in these videos Ken included that the younger generations are rioting because they have been left a world that will soon be uninhabitable if there was no change. I never thought about why the younger generation was angrier about this issue than the older generations, but it made sense after the cigarette example.
</p><hr>


<p>
After watching both videos by Ken I am astonished by how much the generation before mine has done so much to this planet, not in a good way. The first video I watched, “ The climate crisis as a generational issue,” was to me a sign of hope for what can be done to save our planet. Do not get me wrong, I know we are not in a good place right now and that has more to do with the generations that were before myself. From this video I was able to see clips of younger generations that gave me this hope. That even though the climate crisis is among us now I am optimistic that a major change in how the way things are done regarding climate change will be made soon. As the younger generations are growing older they are starting to fight in order to save our planet, which sounds insane to have to say but is reality. As Ken mentioned, yes the changes that must be made to save the planet are rather radical, but are certainly obtainable.
<br><br>
As for the following lecture, “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” it was a much more scientific lecture that stated facts that I was not even aware of. The most eye opening fact that Ken stated was how much the United States contributes to a quarter of all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That is absolutely absurd considering that the US population is only 4% of the global population. Following that fact he stated that the poorest three billion people in the world only account for 5% of the carbon dioxide in the air. Three billion is nearly half of the global population. Ken’s analogy regarding cigarettes was very powerful to me in how it can take just a few people exploiting something that will directly make it worse for others that cannot necessarily do anything about it. It is sad how this earth was left damaged and for us to fix, but it is inspiring to see my generation, and hopefully the following, strongly attempting to fix it regardless of the damage already done.
</p><hr>


<p>
“The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” talks about the current generation having to deal with the lack of action from the parent generation.
<br><br>
I found this to be definitely a change in perspective about how climate change has gotten progressively worse over time. I always seemed to question, “How did it get so bad so fast?” But these two videos seemed to answer it pretty well. It just goes to show that we can no longer be passive and dismissive about it anymore because this is kind of the turning point of how climate change is dealt with in the future and subsequent generations. It should all be a part of our civic duty to be more conscious about how we are contributing to the problem and ways in which we can improve and help our dying planet. Thinking about how the climate has been changing faster in these past few decades than it has compared to the thousands of years of Earth’s history is alarming and it is so important that this generation is the one that does something about it because if we keep going down this path the way we are without doing anything, it may be nearly impossible for the next generation to recover from all the damage we have done to the Earth so far. 
<br><br>
This is why it is so important to have classes such as these because it really works to shed light on climate change like never before. We must start taking action because we are already decades behind.
</p><hr>


<p>
I think it was important to highlight that much of the damage that was one for our planet occurred during the span of a lifetime. It gives us insight that if we continue to follow in the past generations foot steps and do not take responsibility  we will suffer greatly.  The exchange that has been given to those who live in "underdeveloped" nations in regards to their carbon dioxide emissions and the impact they will face is completely unfair. We lack compassion for those who do not have the same resources as us, but who ultimately have to fight our battles for the damage we have done. As mentioned in the video the United States only makes up 4 percent of the total human population, has emitted 1/4 of all the Carbon Dioxide while the poorest 3 billion people only contribute 5%. We are not only putting other human beings, but also every other living organism on this planet in danger due to the lack of responsibility and action in order to combat this climate crisis.
<br><br>
The apology that Ken gave is a step in the right direction, but it doesn't erase the detriment that the current and future generations face. We need much more than an apology. As mentioned in the video the generation that caused most of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are currently still alive. They  should also adapt their life styles in a more sustainable fashion in an attempt to help the planet and fellow human beings. The older generation should not continue to put all the weight on the future generation. They may have less time on the Earth, but their actions still leave an impact.

</p><hr>


<p>
It is truly amazing to think that in a single lifetime, the course of human history has been altered forever. The rapid increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, along with the misuse of chemical pesticides and other technologies have corrupted my future and my children's future. Because of this, my generation has been put in charge of solving the problems the previous generation created.
<br><br>
After watching the lecture video I started to think about the massive change that's going to take place in this new decade. As we come of age and start to become contributing members of society, I believe my generation will at last band together to solve the climate crisis through technology and lifestyle change. I believe that more and more people will start to realize the consequences of consumer culture and realize that that a new phone, or new clothes is not going to bring one happiness. Also, I expect genius feats of engineering to emerge that can combat the climate crisis. Thinking about it now, I am excited to see how our generation solves the problems that our parents gave us. Yeah, we might be a bit more socially awkward because of social media, but we are more aware of current events and the scientific evidence regarding climate change than any other generation. We will be just fine. No need for an apology, we will be just fine. I think.
</p><hr>


<p>
The introduction of the lecture “The climate crisis as a generation issue” take me into more profound thinking. While the reading lists me impacts on earth caused by the climate crisis, this video hit my heart because Ken mentions generations. Human beings developed a lot in the past thousand years and complicated social cultures have shaped and influenced every one of us. One reason that human beings can last so many years is that we reproduce. Continuation is a spiritual word. However, facing the climate crisis now, how could we continue our treasures and cultures to our next generation. We have to admit that a better planet and safe environment is the precondition for any other possibility.
<br><br>
In ken’s “How will climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, he specifically draws a bar chart and I see only 4% of the world population is responsible for more than 66.6% of the CO2 emissions. Roughly 30 billion poor people in undeveloped countries only takes 3% of the CO2 emissions. The point here is not about the gap between wealth and poor but environmental justice. Living in more developed countries, you have a clean, convenient and high-quality life. If all of the developments are built on fossils fuels and overconsuming our plant. We have to figure out ways to solve it. What’s more important is all human beings including children, our next generations, and other life on earth need to bear the consequences of carbon emission which most of the emissions done by developed countries.  
<br><br>
We not only save ourselves but protect all other people and life on earth and our children. In a single generation, CO2 emission increases by 100 ppm. The scene in the video like garbage near river banks, white smog rising into the air, and also beautiful sea world form a contrast. Everyone wants to live in a harmonious and clean earth but in order to have that, we need to do something.
</p><hr>


<p>
I was shocked when I learned how the developed countries in the world have contributed to the carbon emission for the last century. Professor Hiltner's video "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" indicates the emergency of the climate crisis. "The climate crisis as a generational issue." As greenhouse gas like CO2 and methane accumulate in our atmosphere, our future generation will eventually suffer from catastrophic consequences one day. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, I really appreciate how Professor Hiltner apologized to his students about the climate crisis. Everyone should be responsible to make our earth a better place to live.
</p><hr>


<p>
In “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, Ken Hiltner refers to our dependency on fossil fuels as an addiction that has been inherited by subsequent generations, a very interesting point. All those born between 1959 to today know no other way of life than through using fossil fuels as our society is solely built off of it, with our need for transportation, increased appearance of online shopping and basic consumerism, all adding copious amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 
<br><br>
Hitlner also details how the chief pollutants are caused by people that constitute less than half the world’s population yet primarily and rather extremely effect those whose carbon emissions sum up to too insignificant of a percentage to be able to point any blame. The injustice in this is disgusting.
</p><hr>


<p>
After going through this week's readings/films/lectures, it is clear to me that there is a climate crisis. In fact, it has inspired be to be more conscious about being environmentally safe in my daily routine, through actions such as using reusable water bottles. However, I do find it quite a big task to convince the general public of the same consequences. Most of us are a product of our capitalistic society, and that means a product of all of the Amazon 2 day deliveries, gasoline driven cars, and emphasis on convenience. To some extent, its almost a generational problem that will only be effective with the kids that are growing up today. Sure, it can be helpful to try and do our parts as individuals, but unless huge technological strides are made, there is a very slim chance that a majority of the people will be inclined to contribute. The fact of the matter is, sometimes there is no other option than to contribute to the growing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. From flying home to see ones parents to driving to eat a meal from a restaurant, its impossible for one to be completely driven from clean energy. Therefore, I believe that the most viable solution for this monstrous climate crisis in front of us is through the advancement of technology that is renewable and able to be scaled for both poor and rich societies. While believing in people's good will is certainly the ideal way to approach the problem, I don't think enough people will make the necessary changes before it is too late.

Yes, I very much agree with you. While it always feels good to refill your hydro flask instead of reaching for a plastic water bottle, or recycling litter you find on the ground, or even going to the extent of purchasing a hybrid or fully electric automobile, on the scale of the entire planet and the amount of harmful gases that are being released every day it is simply much too small to make a large enough difference. For actual prevention to occur and aid in the slowing down global warming, we need government policy to be made and revolutionary technology to be created and take action. Whether it be enforcing a carbon tax and making worldwide gigafactories or somehow extracting harmful gases into outer space and out of our atmosphere, something on a much grander scale must take place for us to actually have a chance in expanding the lifespan of our planet. I believe the only way we can manage to do something like this is by immediately making worldwide policy and enforcing actual change on the people of the world, whether they understand the consequences or not we need people to be forced into being eco-friendly.

<p>
One of the first points made in this video was that the time delay of climatic consequences was likely the cause of our ancestors’ harmful actions. An entire generation grew up living with this “fossil fuel addiction”, forcing the following generations to correct the problems made in the past. This is the most infuriating part to think about when addressing the culmination of anthropogenic emissions within our world. It’s interesting when comparing our current CO2 emissions with the analogy of smoking. The fact that smoking is widely looked down upon due to its harmful effects on surrounding people, but emitting carbon is not, despite operating under the same circumstances, is outrageous. Both acts are harmful to the environment, yet smoking is only addressed because it directly affects the person doing it. This shows a deeper meaning behind the world’s attempt to ignore climate change, in the sense that “if It isn’t happening to me, it isn’t happening”. 
<br><br>
Additionally, it was sickening to find out that despite the US only making up 4% of the world’s population, we are still one of the biggest carbon emission contributors. Even the poorest 4 billion people in the world (almost half the population) have only contributed to 5% of emissions. This fact is more sad than anything because these people are reaping all of our consequences without experiencing any of the benefits that came from it. These show that the people causing the most problems are not even the ones being affected by the consequences. This video was truly eye-opening and has made me evaluate my own part in consumer culture.
</p><hr>

<p>
While sitting in front of the screen feeling like there’s a bleak future awaits ahead of us, I have mixed feelings about the humans behind the issue of Climate Crisis. I feel futile as major politicians who holds power in the office prevents taking critical policies to be made against climate changes, as I feel hopeful that our own generation would bring a brighter future to tomorrow. No matter if it's due to our fear of a acropolytic future or our own sense of duty for this planet, I am proud of the people of our generation stepping out of their houses to take on actions and make their voices be heard by the mass public. Meanwhile, the time would come when people from our generation who understands the big picture start taking prominent roles in the office, and they would be the one making the difference to averse what generations before us had done. Meanwhile, what suffers behind climate change are more to the Earth itself, it includes those who are less unfortunate than us and do nothing but watch elites irresponsibly destroy their homes and families. Climate justice is a real tragedy for the sake of humanity, as it must be “justified” by us.
</p><hr>

<p>
From the lecture “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, Professor Ken Hiltner provides us many crucial proofs and facts to help us understand climate crisis more and how we can slow down the climate crisis. It is so striking that the worse condition of our atmosphere was caused just in a short and single lifetime. Worsely, people who make the condition worse are still alive and keep doing it.
<br><br>
What we can do first, and the most important one is that we should be thoroughly if we want to change the climate condition based on the professor Ken. Instead of putting more burdens on the environment like using more fossil fuels, it is really important to change people’s diet because of the huge population. To avoid the huge population making more and more carbon dioxide, changing the diet from beef to vegetables play an important role in decreasing the methane gas. In addition, time delay of the consequences of the climate crisis, from my perspective, is one urgent warning which tell the consequence if we do not take any action to change. The fact is that the global temperature rose much faster than the scientists think. But many people ignored this thing. The cover their eyes. But I am still optimistic that we still have time to do all of these things to change the environment.
</p><hr>

<p>
While I was watching this video I could truly see the hurt in Ken’s face and realized that he truly feels sorry for the earth and the next generations of animals living on it. I thought it was very clever of him to come up with the cigarette analogy when he compared it to the climate crisis. He basically highlighted the fact that his generation along with the two after are knowingly destroying the Earth for the upcoming generation of children. I was not very surprised when Ken revealed that most of the CO2 emissions had been released in the past 60 years because most of us did not realize how serious the climate crisis was until now. Although many people continue abusing fossil fuels today, there are some of us, including myself, who are determined to decrease their carbon footprint dramatically not only for ourselves but for the rest of life on Earth and the Earth itself. Unfortunately, as Ken had touched on in his video, the poorer countries who do not abuse fossil fuels are currently getting the short end of the stick. The weather is hitting these places the hardest due to the increased amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and they are not wealthy enough to deal with the consequences in a timely manner, let alone at all. At some point, every country needs to come together and not only provide themselves with wind, or solar-powered technology, but they need to provide these same resources for the poorer countries as well. The less wealthy countries needn’t follow in our footsteps and use fossil fuels. There is no need for that to happen, nor can we afford for that to happen. If the rest of the population started to rely on fossil fuels, the crisis would become even worse and we would experience the consequences much sooner than predicted.

</p><hr>

<p>
the same sentiment is shared between the two videos “the climate crisis as a generational issue” and this video, in sharing the massively impactful and harmful consequences of carbon production. The delayed impact of environmental abuse will lead to human suffering. Anthropogenic human driven climate change was most harmful in the last lifetime, as greenhouse gases, most specifically CO2, started entering the atmosphere- suffocating the earth and polluting the atmosphere. These two videos bring profound attention to the crisis. The consequences of our global abuses will be felt violently by subsequent generations, hopefully a deterrent to our modern actions.
</p><hr>

<p>
I really liked the analogy of how using fossil fuels is like being addicted to cigarettes. Even though people know that fossil fuels are bad for the environment some people still see it as necessary, I believe the analogy to something commonly known as a short time enjoyment with many long term consequences truly show what using fossil fuels is doing to the world. The video as a whole just effectively reiterates how the climate change issue is very much human caused and will bring damage that people alive today will suffer through and definitely their kids and grandchildren. This video also reveals the injustice that is and will continue to grow around the world where countries that contributed very little to greenhouse gases will suffer the most.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching the lecture video, “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single life time” I am still skeptical that humanity did not expect any consequences from emitting tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. I will comply that maybe humanity did not know to the degree and extent the results of their actions would result such as radical climate change; but I do believe that humans knew that polluting the atmosphere was not right to begin with and surely problems would rise from it, in the future. Therefore, humanity continued to profit from burning fossil fuel, expecting that the future generation could repair their mistake with technological advances. However, the future is here now and we are yet to tackle the problem head on due to fossil fuel corporations who refuse to stop their scheme. For that reason and as mentioned in the lecture video, the United States is one main contributor to the carbon footprint because companies such as the Koch Brothers and Chevron, have bribes politicians and environmental expects to deny the reality of the climate crisis and prevent any environmental acts from passing into law. Due to their selfishness, third world countries are currently enduring and suffering the consequences these corrupt businessmen caused since day one. 
<br><br>
What I found disturbing was the fact that a single species has impacted the world to this expect. Humanity has been present in the world for a small percentage to the overall life span of the planet. Within that small percentage we have made it almost inhabitable for animals as well as humans. We are a destructive species, who seeks more and more of everything not taking into account that our actions have direct and indirect consequences. For that reason, the youth movement, talked in “The climate crisis as a generational issue,'' has made it clear that they are seeking change through protest and petition to secure a liveable home for themselves, their children and future grandchildren.
</p><hr>

<p>
From the video “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” I have learned that the issue of climate crisis is escalated just in the past few decades. The consequences of emitting CO2 are hardly to be seen in the short term, but when we are aware about the damage, it has already become a significant problem. Besides, it is hard to believe that one-eighth of the world’s population, which is the sum of U.S., Europe, and Russia, is responsible of the two-third of the CO2 emission. Within these statistics, U.S., which is only four percent of the world’s population, emits twenty-five percent of CO2. It sounds pretty ironic that the most developed regions in the world are causing the climate crisis to be more severe, but those regions that are not much developed are also suffering and even suffering more.
</p><hr>

<p>
Ken’s video, “How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime,” really opened my eyes to the rapid pace at which the earth is deteriorating. By relating the CO2 levels in the atmosphere to his age, Ken really puts into perspective just how quickly we are endangering the earth for us and future generations. We need to learn to live more sustainably and to be less wasteful as atmospheric CO2 levels rise at an accelerating rate.

<p>
I am both disgusted by the content of this lecture and very appreciative that this lecture was given. I am disgusted at the extreme amount of climate injustice happening in our world and at the generational inequalities of the climate crisis. But I am also greatly appreciative that this lecture is bringing to light these issues, especially since it opens up the presenter (Ken) to fault since he is part of the generation and the country that caused all these problems. For that, I thank Ken for his bravery and dedication to this issue and I demand that his contemporaries do the same. It may be embarrassing for older generations and people from fortunate countries (myself included) to admit such responsibility in the greatest challenge that humans have ever encountered, but it is absolutely necessary for it to be done if we are to hope to solve this crisis. 
<br><br>
This lecture goes into the concepts of climate injustice and the generational inequalities of the climate crisis. The wealthiest countries in the world are the main ones responsible for causing the climate crisis, yet are the most protected against the effects of the crisis. It is the poorer countries, the ones who have contributed the least to killing our planet, that will be on the frontlines experiencing the hell that is the climate crisis. This is also not a theoretical injustice of the future. This is happening right now. The lecture also goes into the fact that younger generations are rightfully enraged about the climate crisis since we will face more consequences than previous generations (the main climate polluters) ever had to deal with.
</p><hr>

<p>
In Hiltner's lecture video, "The climate crisis as a generational issue", I would say that Professor Hiltner did an incredible job in explaining how climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime. In addition, I would also like to thank Professor Hiltner in creating this video for students and for the whole public. This is exactly what we need to shift our focus into. Our world, together with all the species and humanity are endangered because of carbon emissions. Firms and sadly, our political leaders throughout the world, disregard this issue or see Climate Change as the least thing they have to worry about. Hiltner provided us with lenses that display the consequences of constant carbon emission to society. Humanity may not be able to see it visually, or perhaps, do not experience it currently. But, Climate Change is happening as I write this comment, it is everywhere in our environment. Climate Change and its drawbacks could possibly affect future generations and their Survivability.
<br><br> 
Finally, I would like to thank Professor Hiltner for apologizing on behalf of all boomers in regards of Climate Change. Hiltner admits that his generation has failed and is continually contributing to the Climate Change. Hiltner definitely earned my respect, rather than contribute more to the ongoing issue of Climate Change like most boomers did, Hiltner took the role of by educating students like me and the public, together we could heal our Planet. The whole lecture video really impacted me in a way that our system got to change, all these capitalism needs to be minimized, hence, our political leaders needs to be changed. In order for that to happen, We as a society need to do our part and work together to repair our planet.

After watching Ken's lecture video, I understood why climate change was allowed to happen and why few people have intervened. Since you cannot see all the greenhouse gases in the air, it’s easy to assume that emitting greenhouse gases won't do much damage to the earth. Since the effects of climate change take a long time to appear, nobody cared about stopping it. It's kind of like procrastinating on an essay - you don't worry about the problem until it’s too late. I do not think a single generation should be blamed for the climate crisis because we all share responsibility by continuing to use fossil fuels. Instead of wasting time apologizing, you should continue spreading your message and fighting against climate change. 
<br><br>
I think it's sad that developed nations can enjoy the luxuries of industry and technology while less developed countries suffer from our actions. We emit carbon dioxide without any thought towards others. We have a responsibility to the less fortunate to make this world a better and safer place. We must work to solve the climate crisis.
</p><hr>

<p>
While watching both videos, "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" and "The climate crisis as a generational issue", I felt very emotional. It is a wild concept to think that in a single lifetime, the life span of a single generation of people, the Earth has become so damaged and drained of life. I am very proud to be part of the maturing youth that have started to recognize the damages done and fight for improvement and environmental justice. We are taking action to try to reverse or simply just stop further damage to the Earth. 
<br><br>
The information I learned in the videos are extremely disheartening. The United States is producing a disproportionate amount of CO2 in relation to our population. It is completely unjust that such a large percentage of the world's population who have little to do with the mass amounts of CO2 emission will suffer the consequences of mindless complacency and consumerism. I am guilty of not always being environmentally conscious because it is not always at the forefront of my mind and this needs to be changed. The climate crisis is upon us, and has been for a long time. This class has made me much more aware of the world I live in and the changes I must make to my personal lifestyle. It is difficult to reverse decades of environmentally damaging habits, but an effort must be made.
</p><hr>

<p>
This video actually caught me quite off guard. I do not recall having ever heard a genuine apology for the current Climate Crisis, so I was very refreshed. While clearly apologies are not nearly enough to fix what we as human beings, and particularly as US citizens have done, I believe that taking responsibility for our part in the destruction of our planet is a necessary and important step towards reparation. In taking responsibility for our actions and inactions, we acknowledge that we have control over them, and that we can do better. Apologizing empowers us to relinquish our defensive attitudes, the ones that lead people climate change’s existence, to adopt “so what” attitudes, and even to pull out of climate accords. Apologizing signals to ourselves and each other that there’s a better way, and that we’re willing to work toward it. I would like to join Professor Hiltner in apologizing for my role in causing the climate crisis. To poor coastal villages already being engulfed in waves, to the people in my own town whose houses were consumed by flames, to numerous organisms in dying ecosystems on land and in the sea, to whatever children and grandchildren I may have in the future, and to myself: I’m sorry. My lifestyle, though a small drop in the bucket that is greenhouse gas emissions, has undoubtedly contributed to the global issue. My habits, I’m sure, regularly harm the earth in ways I do not fully understand, and because of my privileged life, I will not pay as strong a price as the all but innocent. I don’t fully understand how to change, only that a change must be made. I want a better future, I believe in a better future, we need a better future. Together, we can move past our mistakes and toward that better future. We’ve got to try.
</p><hr>

<p>
I believe the analogy used to compare the effects of CO2 emissions to the effects of smoking on children was very powerful. Although it was just a hypothetical situation, if people knew that choosing to smoke cigarettes would result in detrimental effects to their children, most people would not smoke. I believe the same mindset needs to be acquired regarding our emissions and climate change. Many of the older generations living on our planet may not have the desire to significantly alter their lifestyles to lower emissions, because they do not believe the harsh consequences will be seen in their lifetime. This type of mindset desperately needs to change. As our population and reliance on fossil fuels exponentially increases, the consequences we may once have believed to be far away, are beginning to be seen today.
 
While watching this lecture, the idea that the United States is responsible for 25 percent of all of the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere was astonishing to me. If you compare that to our population ratio to the world, only 4 percent, it is truly unbelievable that we have made such a big impact on this problem. Statistics like these should lead us to reflect on our lifestyle choices as a country. By looking at other successful country’s statistics, it is evident that there is no excuse for our emissions reaching these levels. These statistics should be very motivational for us to implement new legislation and lifestyles changes that reduce our footprint.
</p><hr>


<p>
In the first video, “The climate crisis as a generational issue”, professor Hiltner states that what the older generation did to the environment has greatly brought negative influence to the newer generation, and the newer will suffer a lot more climate crisis in the future. It is inspiring to see that a portion of my generation starts fighting for a sustainable environment, but there is still a long way to go: we not only need to educate the older and try to change their way of living but also need to educate the younger about how to prevent further destruction.

In the second video, “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, professor Hiltner further claims his point that we need to be aware that our irresponsible behaviors nowadays will largely damage our descendants, and this concept is vividly demonstrated by the cigarette analogy. The apology in the end touches me, and I think the thing that we need to do right now is not blaming but engage into a sustainable lifestyle more actively and propagate this kind of attitude of protecting the environment to more people.
</p><hr>


<p>
One thing I appreciated about these lecture videos was the fact that Ken put the climate crisis into a better perspective. I believe that if every person could recognize the detrimental effect their own actions have on the future generations then the climate crisis wouldn’t be nearly as bad as it is today. However, it is this ignorance that is brought about by extreme corporate greed and bias towards personal interest that is hindering environmentalists efforts to slow down global warming and possibly create a better future for the next generation than what is planned now. It is extremely mind blowing the harm we have done to the planet, and furthermore it is almost unbelievable that a majority of this harm was done in less than 100 years. Therefore, the almost inevitable question, that we as a society have to answer is how to respond to this crisis and what steps we should take to prevent our ultimate demise at the hands of rising global temperatures, increasing sea levels and the depletion of the ozone layer. The obvious first step is to become aware of anthropogenic climate change and then begin the global effort of changing our lifestyle habits to fit the requirements of an environmentally friendly lifestyle. 
<br><br>
Yet again, the material thus far presented in the lecture was a bit alarmist, as it should be due to the fact this style of rhetoric is required to open the public's eyes towards the reality of the climate crisis. The smoking analogy for example was a perfect illustration of the ignorance of the older generations had towards the environment, and furthermore the danger and pressure they are placing on the younger generations who are simply trying to survive while fighting the crisis they had no part in creating. The takeaway I had from this lecture is that it is our duty as the newer generation to fix the problems created by our elders so that there is a future for the next generations to come.
</p><hr>


<p>
In the lecture “ How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” and  “ The climate crisis as a generational issue”, the speaker revealed that human factors played negative roles in climate change and the damage will be continuing in the future since the whole process of climate change is slow and most people still doubt its authenticity. I think the example of cigarettes is very persuasive since people have already witnessed the harmful consequence of smoking and how smokers get serious lung problems after several decades. Though people may feel nothing in the short term, most of them are likely to feel regretful as time goes on. Climate change also influences our health, environment, and economy in a slow and tiny process that sea level and global temperature rise every year. Another impressive fact developed countries take up 2/3 in total emission of carbon dioxide and the poorest people only take up 5 percentage. It is quite ironic that people with high literacy in stable societies still ignore the truth of climate change and keep contaminating the environment and wasting natural resources. Some politicians even support companies to accelerate the situation and hide the truth of climate change from people. I think every individual should realize the crisis of climate change and make a difference in daily lifestyles. Also, the climate crisis should be introduced to more people so that they are able to believe in the truth.
</p><hr>



<p>
In this video, Professor Hiltner’s message about CO2 increasing by 100ppm in his lifetime so far profoundly illustrated the urgency of the issue. Humans have been on this plant for so many years now and yet it’s the last couple decades have caused so much damage. Humans are all contributing to climate change, but the fact that wealthier countries contribute such a disproportionate amount and is highly unfair to those who didn’t contribute as much and will be punished potentially even more. While I had assumed that the US and other developed countries were contributing more to the climate crisis, I had no idea of the extent. The fact that 25% of all the CO2 in the atmosphere is contributed by the US and 66% from the US. Europe, and Russia astounds me. 
<br><br>
I am so grateful for people like Professor Hiltner and other climate change activists who are spearheading change in our relationship with the environment. It makes me optimistic to see that so many younger people are getting involved and contributing to change as well. Helps to take a step back and appreciate the fact that there are classes like this one taught to hundreds of students at a large public university because this means more and more people will be educated about this issue.

</p><hr>



<p>
I believe that in “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” Professor Hiltner did an amazing job on addressing how the climate crisis stemmed from a past generation, yet the responsibility of fixing the planet has fallen on the future generations. He illustrates how his generation has deeply influenced the climate crisis we are living in today and apologizes on behalf of his generation (baby boomers) for having caused such serious issues we face today. The United States had a great increase in birth rates after World War II and hence the population grew immensely. Once the population increased, the demand for food and supplies increased as well. 
<br><br>
I found his lecture very interesting, as well as his apology on behalf of his generation, which was so heart-warming to know that they too are now on this journey with us to a positive future.
</p><hr>



<p>
This lecture video, "How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime" puts into perspective how the climate will affect the generations to come. I think one of the problems with our society is that some people are unwilling to understand the current climate, and the metaphors that Ken utilizes, describes it in a way that anyone cannot ignore. Adults right now are likely to be gone before the crisis peaks, and they seem to have a "not my problem" mindset. I believe that if they saw this video, they might change their mind. 
<br><br>
In addition, Ken gives an extremely helpful explanation in how people are affecting the climate. It is tragic that this is ultimately caused by a small percentage of the world's population, and everyone else does not get a say in what happens. It is even more tragic that the United States is one of the sole contributors to this crisis. It makes me more grateful when I see people in the U.S. strive to live a more sustainable life. 
<br><br>
I also appreciate the fact that Ken mentions his generation were the ones who are responsible for the disaster that is occurring on our planet. His comment reminded me of something that my AP Gov teacher stated about the current state of our society: "Our country will be much more accepting when my generation leaves power seats and your generation takes them." This gives me even more hope that we will eventually be able to reverse any negative events that have happened whether its politics or the climate.

<p>
Before taking English 22 in the fall I had always assumed that the causes of climate change must have gone back generations and slowly built up to the crisis we are met with today. It can be somewhat difficult to fathom just how quickly we changed our climate because of the massive escalation in the use of fossil fuels. It is especially important that more people realize that the climate crisis is a generational issue because it really highlights just how important is it that we make changes now, not later. If we ignored this escalation and continued on thinking that our actions will only affect those who will come after us soon enough there could be no “later” to worry about. It is shocking to see how we made such a large jump from 315 ppm to 415 ppm of CO2 in just sixty years after only escalating 35 ppm for quite some time. While it can be hard to think of such a small value of parts per million being significant to put it in perspective just 35 ppm of carbon monoxide in the air is toxic. While carbon dioxide is not toxic for us to breathe in, like carbon monoxide, it still poses a serious threat for our environment’s well being and 415 ppm is a dangerous number. 
<br><br>
One thing that I have noticed as I have started my transition to a more sustainable lifestyle along with my parents is that people from my generation are much more accepting than those from my parents’ generation. My parents’ mainly vegan diet tends to attract judgmental comments from people their age while the youth are much more accepting and supportive. This toxic behavior from older generations is worrisome because those who are attempting to fix a problem brought on during their lifetime are being met with criticism rather than support. Knowing that the majority of the older generations are not only resisting change but are also judging those who have started to make lifestyle changes is incredibly discouraging at times. I truly appreciate professor Hiltner’s apology for how his generation has mistreated the earth and ignored teaching us sustainability while we were growing up. It was very respectable to see someone acknowledging their own faults because we are all guilty of ignoring sustainability at times. Most importantly as we grow and learn we need to keep ourselves, and each other, accountable.  
<br><br>
Although every fact we learn and analogy we hear, such as professor Hiltner’s cigarette example, can be more terrifying than encouraging there does seem to be some small moments of hope when looking at the youth today. More and more young people are taking steps to make their voices heard and make changes in their everyday lives. None of us are perfect and avoiding single use plastic can be a particularly challenging task some days but with so many organizations and protests readily available we are often given many chances to do our part. While our generation may be mad about the state of the planet we have inherited we are more than willing to work hard and do our best to salvage what remains.

“The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” both serve extremely helpful in navigating the reality of climate change. These videos both successfully pinpointed the root of who is truly responsible for an unwelcoming earth and the present downfall of humanity and all of our counterparts here on earth. It is insane to think about how the rate at which we are depleting resources that exist for not just our purpose and ultimately killing the earth over economic gain. I always think about how mostly all older generations consider while voting are candidates that express interest in the politics of taxes and the economy when literally none of it will matter if they're aiding in creating a inhospitable environment for their grandchildren. It truly boggles my mind that the entire countries first priority isn't in regards to climate change. I also believe that not only have younger generations been raised to keep acting in the same way that is aiding to our downfall, but also to actively ignore it. For example, we have access to the power of social media and the internet, a way to spread news and events with the entire world within just a couple of seconds however every day most social media users are blind to disasters happening around the world each day. There definitely seems to be a pick and choose system when celebrity news is constantly advertised yet half of America is oblivious to Australia practically burning down.

<p>
“How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” offers a useful starting point to understanding how climate change has developed over time, and how this development has shaped people’s opinions on the matter. It is hard to believe that people’s perspectives are even split on climate change; the effects are seemingly obvious, and even if they weren’t brought about due to climate change, aren’t the issues still terrible enough for people to want to take action? It is a sad reality that future generations and poor and impoverished countries will have to suffer in the future and pay the price of our greed and selfishness. We consume and consume with no regard to how it will hurt us in the future. There is a cause and effect to everything. Just because we can’t see it in the now doesn’t mean that it won’t happen later on. We need to become more conscious of our actions and how they will affect not only ourselves, but our future generations. This is a problem we need to face together. Taking individual action is great, but I don’t think it will be enough, and thus we must move forward together and think about one another and the repercussions our actions. As Ken stated, our dependence on fossil fuels has brought us the wealth we have today, but at a price that now seems too high to pay. I can only hope the solutions we come up with and implement will spare the suffering of future generations.

In “The climate as a generational issue “ I saw some of the differences between the older and younger generation on the climate crisis. During the older generation's time the climate crisis was not an issue really discussed or advocated as much as it is now with the younger generation as seen in the video. I found inspiring the fact that the younger generation are taking action. Yet I think climate change is not being talked about enough, I think everyone regardless of generation should become informed and try to do their part for some change. The fossil fuel crisis is still very much a current problem and having support from the older generation in the matter is important. I found interesting the reason for not taking action in the climate crisis, being that people do not see any major consequences so they choose not to think about it. Such as with someone who smokes excessively can not see how badly their lungs are being damaged over a long period of smoking. As they say out of sight out of mind. If people saw a truly major consequence first hand in their daily life they would be more prompt to act, but since it does not interfere with their daily life they see no need to do anything.In the “ How the climate crisis was brought about in the single lifetime” I was shocked on how much damage  was done in recent years. I was shocked when he compared the carbon dioxide release level increase, before 1955 to 1955 having an increase of 35 ppm versus 1995 to 2019 having an increase of 100 ppm. I like how Ken said that the effects perhaps won’t affect people from older generations but it will for their children in the future and that is very true. I appreciated the fact that Ken apologized for the inaction of his generation. The fossil fuel crisis is still very much a current problem and having support from the older generation  along with the younger generation in the matter is important.

<p>
Referring to the first video deals with how the previous generations have brought about the Crisis that us newer generations have grown into and are now beginning to see the effects of, I can see how it could fill us with rage and confusion about the topic, but I think that we need to step back and see the issue as a whole. Even though the problem was created and is stilling on going due to past generations, the last thing we should do is be enraged because there is no way to fix the past, all we can do is try and better the future the best we can. What we need to do is begin to bring as many facts to all- new and old generations, to educate them and raise the alertness of all of us as a whole. The only step we can take is forward so while we can look at the past to se where we went wrong, the best we can do now is learn from those mistakes. The cigarette analogy to explain it allows us to see it project from the small scale to the larger scale quite adequately.
<br>
When looking into the second video, it does raise a concern that I had known about prior to the course, but now I am beginning to see the full extent of it. It amazes me that how all of the billions of years that the earth has been around, that only about 400 years can make that all crumble. As we see with most other issues caused by the more wealthy and rich countries, the burden ends up falling upon the poorer countries. The main issue with this whole crisis is the ignorance that the United States and other wealthy countries exert on the issue, rather than take the blame, to put it somewhere else. I believe that self-awareness and admission to the mistakes that were made are necessary first steps to beginning to fight the crisis that we have created.

</p><hr>

<p>
Before watching this video I had little to no regard to the consequences that mine and everyone else's actions will have on future generations to come. I admittedly and yet unfortunately would say that my perspective on climate change has been largely egocentric for I failed to acknowledge the negative impact that my every decision will have on others and generations to follow. Although many would say Ken's generation (boomers) and those before his should be held responsible for contributing to our current climate change issues, I would argue that the generations that are taking over the torch (Gen X, Millennials,  and Gen Z) are just as much responsible. Like the boomers, the majority of the younger generations have yet to take initiative and lead humanity to a healthier world. Although a wide variety of efforts have been taken by many to raise awareness of and tackle the issues of climate change, the sad reality is that most people are oblivious to the rotting environment around them. Many are instead too focused on the article of clothing they are going to buy next, the newest device they want to purchase, or the next place they are going to drive to. Instead of contributing to the conservation of energy and the practice of donating clothes we persist to pollute our world by purchasing the new line of Yeezys and Gucci products that are arriving. It takes more than just a handful of the population to make a difference.
</p><hr>



<p>
I found Ken’s lecture to be very eye-opening.  While I have taken classes about Climate Change and Global Warming in the past, I was glad to be able to learn new things that I had never been presented with before. For example, while I have of course noticed the generational divide that Climate Change issues have made clear, I never realized the reasoning for it.  It has always greatly frustrated me when speaking with the generations above mine that they generally don’t view climate change as as pressing of an issue as the majority of the younger population does. I was able to gather some understanding which I never considered before, as Ken expresses through his cigarette analogy, if people do not receive an immediate consequence for their actions, they are unlikely to stop them.  However, this makes me wonder if this can truly be corrected? It seems as though this is a trait of human nature. While our generation is beginning to comprehend the consequences of our actions, it is unlikely that even we will be able to see the impact in time to act upon it. 
<br><br>
The other thing that I found very interesting was the topic of environmental injustice. While I knew that the United States produced a very large amount of fossil fuels, I did not realize how drastic it was in comparison to the other countries in the world. The fact that only 5% of CO2 is produced by the collective poorest countries in the world is crazy to think about. Further, it makes me sad to think about the way in which we are impacting the future of the entire globe. Any decision that an individual makes from their eating habits, to the amount of waste they produce, to the amount of children they have, not only affects themselves and their own families, but the entire population. And for some, they will have no way to fight it, due to finances. 
<br><br>
Overall I found this video very enlightening, and shared it with my friends and my high school Environmental Science teacher, because I think they are things that should be shown and expressed to many people. If we are fighting to correct these issues, we need as many people united as possible.
</p><hr>



<p>
This video touched on the answers to the major question asked by many young people today, “Why did the climate crisis happen so fast?” We, as an up and coming generation, have been left with a world quickly crumbling due to the actions of the people who lived before us. Ken, in this video, explained how the idea of time delay when it came to the consequences of the actions of the generation before us was one of the main reasons for the increasing speed of climate change today through an example of smoking. I believe that it isn’t fair that the last generation left us to clean up after the mess they left behind when that mess may soon become impossible to fix. 
<br><br>
By the end of the video, Ken also apologized on behalf of his generation as well as promised to do all he can to help fix what his generation left behind. Although I commend his apology, I still believe that his generation is not doing enough to help with fixing the climate crisis, especially in the government. I believe a lot of people from Ken’s generation tend to only complain about how global warming will have an effect on their offspring and grandchildren, but do nothing to amend the situation or try to begin to clean up the mess they have created. Until dire consequences begin to be seen on a global level, people will continue to ignore the increasing risk that comes with the continued use of fossil fuels. By then, it will be too late.
</p><hr>



<p>
Honestly, I didn’t expect knowing this, that “the climate crisis was brought in a single life time”. Although I know a little bit that the carbon dioxide emission soared after industrialization, the accurate amount of that almost doubled after our professor, Ken was born. And those people who did this to our world are still doing the same thing now because they’ve already used to it, nobody gave them any warnings when they dominated the world in the past decades. When they are harming the planet by digging up fossil fuels, they didn’t think about the consequences of that, and what this action would do to others, like the analogy of cigarettes in the lecture. 
<br><br>
There’s an ironic fact too. While the so-called developed world like the US only made up about one eighth of the world’s population, they contributed about two thirds of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Aren’t the developed countries supposed to create less of that since they are already “developed”? While the poorest population in the world almost doesn’t have any contribution to the CO2 emission. I really think the developed world should change right now.
</p><hr>



<p>
The video “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about a single lifetime” shows us how this generation ignore the effect of global warming, and in the next several generations,  our children and even grandchidren will  suffer this terrible effect. It is very unpredictable that 1/8 people make this virtually co2 emitting, because in other undeveloped country,  they didn't do anything with the emitting of co2. So we should do everything single thing in our life, to avoid smoking,  avoid using gases. There is no back way for people to recongize this issue, this is extemely late for people to make actions.
<br><br>
I feel very unfair and angry to these 1/8 people in these developed countries, because they do everything bad thing and they don't need to consider the bad result. The only thing we can do is that following the instruction of this video, doing  effective things immediately. it is note late to begin actions.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching “ How the Climate Crisis was brought about in a single lifetime “ I felt ashamed of our country and the decisions we have made.  The United States is a superpower and we set an example with our actions.  We have shown the world to care about wealth and greed instead of preserving our home for future generations to come.  As stated in the lecture politicians are still protecting corporations that put absurd amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere and if it doesn't change soon it will be too late. 
<br><br>
             In one lifetime we have put  ¾ of the total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and the amount we use only seems to go up.   It is scary and frustrating that even with so many indisputable facts that prove The Climate Crisis is a primary concern, yet people only believe what they want to believe in.  The previous generation tends to not believe in climate change or chooses to turn a blind eye as the side effects are "far down the road".  The example that Ken uses the smoker that lights up without no consequences just to pass it down to his children, is a perfect example of what the old generation is doing to the new one.  We will be the ones that have to live in the world that the last generation handed down to us.  Our generation can’t be like our predecessors and pick up their fossil fuel habits.  As shown in the first video the earth is on the new generation's shoulders and we can’t let it down.
</p><hr>

<p>
I like the fact that this important issue can be put into different perspectives - such as explaining the impact of the climate crisis as a multi-generational consequence of smoking. The fact that people now know how dangerous and lethal smoking can be leads them to viewing this climate crisis under a more serious account. This also allows for a bigger audience to comprehend the danger that world is under due to the decisions we make as a world, and more gravely the decisions we make here in the United States. It’s a little disappointing, but I think it’s important to compare the climate crisis to more “daily-life” and present culture references in order for more of the population to actually understand and want to take action in saving this planet. 
<br><br>
Hopefully the extension of ways we can describe the climate crisis can educate more people and help the majority of the population from turning a blind eye. The climate crisis may be this generational issue inflicted upon us by past generations, but hopefully this current generation is the one to take a stand and make things right before it’s too late.
</p><hr>



<p>
After watching “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” and "The climate crisis as a generational issue,” I learned some facts that the CO2 in the atmosphere has already increased from 280 PPM to 415 PPM from years ago which shocked me because PPM has increased at a rate so fast that it was not predicted, and ironically, the poorest 3 billion people in the world are only responsible for 5% of the emissions However,  the most developed countries with the greatest carbon footprint will not suffer as much due to the money they have made off of fossil fuel industries. Both of these two facts make me feel angry and hopeless.
<br><br>
In addition, the answers to the major question asked by many youths today, “Why did the climate crisis happen so fast” are given by these videos. As the current generation, we have been left with a world quickly crumbling due to the actions of the people who lived before us. The cigarette analogy made by Professor Ken is a perfect example of this phenomenon. The fact that smoking is widely paid attention to because of its negative effects on surrounding people, but emitting carbon is not, despite operating under the same circumstances, is outrageous. Both acts are harmful to the environment, yet smoking is only addressed because it directly affects the person doing it. This shows a deeper meaning behind the world’s attempt to ignore climate change, in the sense that “if It isn’t happening to me, it isn’t happening”.
</p><hr>

<p>
“The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” illustrate many unfair facts happening because of the climate crisis. New generations come out to the street asking why people let everything goes by this far. Why do we have to suffer the terrible climate which was destroyed by others. Similarly, many people from developing countries are asking why they have to suffer the bad consequences which were primarily made by a few developed countries such as the U.S., Europe and Russia. The analogy of smoking cigarettes is a nice way to show how the climate crisis looks like in a small picture. I strongly agree with Ken’s statement that the delay of the consequences is a huge problem. People get optimistic when they do not see bad consequences of devastating the environment.
</p><hr>

It has been proven time and time again that older generations find new generational trends and problems hard to adapt to and accept. For example, slavery and racism against African-Americans as an issue and hate crime was not abolished only by activists like MLK or Lincoln, but by a large part by time. The older, more traditional generation dying out due to the passage of time is the true breaker of chains, allowing for African-Americans to gain their equality. The same is true for other generational progressions, such as same-sex marriage and the stopping of apartheid. 
<br><br>
As we head into the climate crisis, the current generational issue, a large factor in fighting global warming is once again, time. As the younger generations are more educated about the climate crisis, more open-minded about accepting the harsh realities of the future of Earth, I feel optimistic that mankind will eventually come to a solution.
<br><br>
Although time will change mindsets, we are fighting against time as well. It's clear that the more years pass, the more we continue emitting greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and the more our planet suffers. While previous generational issues dealt more with people and society, our crisis deals with our planet's future. Whether or not mankind's mindset shifts before our planet is doomed will determine our fate.

While watching these lectures, I couldn't help but become more frustrated with the reality of this issue and the lack of action being taken. I found it interesting how Ken mentioned that there will be a time delay in the consequences that arise. This made me think about how we will eventually reach a tipping point in time where the effects of climate change will be overwhelming irreversible. Once this tipping point is reached mitigation will no longer help but rather radical solutions will have to be adopted. I also found it frustrating how the developed world alone was responsible for some ⅔ of emissions yet the consequences of climate change will be hardest felt by less developed nations. Moreover, developed nations have unfortunately fostered a culture of consumerism that is unsustainable. Today most Americans don't think twice about purchasing a burger or getting in their car to drive to work however it is these everyday habits that altogether accumulate in giving the United States one of the largest carbon footprints on Earth. In the United States and other developing nations, the everyday use of fossil fuels has become a habit of convenience rather than a habit of necessity.
<br><br>
I found the analogy of the cigarette to be particularly thought provoking. I think many of the people in the generation responsible for this accelerated warming fail to realize that the very people directly affected will be their posterity. Additionally it is that generation that refuses to make the necessary political changes that would help mitigate the actions that contribute to climate change. Now, as Ken mentioned, this generational issue has been passed on and while little action is currently being taken, I believe changes at a political level would have the most powerful impact on changing the public’s actions.

<p>
Ken’s apology on behalf of his generation saddened me to watch, especially in that those who have caused far more damage (those in power specifically) and continue to abuse the planet ignorantly are not even the ones apologizing. While Ken apologizes for his generation in teaching our generation similar, wrong ways, I feel that what matters is that what we know now and those previously wrong who are now among us in this fight. His lecture sheds light on how poorer places suffer much more on the environmental end of the stick than the more developed places, as a result of richer countries contributing the most through wasteful, damaging activity. It is heartbreaking to see the injustice in that the poorest three billion people are suffering the most while contributing to the problem the least, and a significant amount at that.
<br><br>
The cigarette analogy placed the situation in a more personal perspective, making us really think about how there are everlasting consequences from our lifestyle and actions. We may have taken up the habits of those before us, living unsustainably, ignoring consequences that although are delayed are very much severe consequences, but we know now how much one lifetime has damaged this planet and it is what we do with that information that counts.
</p><hr>
<p>
In the lecture, “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, I was taken aback the most by how few people/countries it took for the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere to rise as much as it did in one lifetime.  The statistic that struck me the hardest was the fact that the US contributed to a quarter of the CO2 in the atmosphere while “Americans constitute just 4% of the world's population” (Hiltner, 2020).  The scariest part for me that I did not know the extent of what was happening and the extreme disparities between who was killing the planet and who was suffering because of it.  The environmental injustice that is being committed on this earth is not discussed or addressed in the capacity that it needs to be.  
<br><br>
I think that the developed countries who are contributing the most CO2 into the atmosphere need to be held accountable for their actions and need to come up with more solutions than problems.  With each dollar that goes towards the fossil fuel industry, one needs to go towards research or funding for projects that work towards mitigating the effects of climate change before it’s too late.  This solution may be idealistic with where our society is at now, but if action is not taken quickly from the individuals and companies that are pumping obscene amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, then in a few short years- it’ll be too late.
</p><hr>
<p>
After watching both “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” lectures I found myself dumbstruck over the concept that Professor Ken made; the idea that the climate crisis has been a generational issue, and unless we decide to make changes in or everyday lives as well as in our economic industries, it will continue to be that way. I always saw the climate crisis as an issue brought about in my lifetime, as if it were made by causes of my generation. In reality, according to the lectures, it is an issue that has been around for decades and has just progressively gotten worse. I was shocked to learn that in only 60 years the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere climbed from 315 ppm in 1959 to 415 ppm in 2019. It was appalling to learn that 75% of all the the greenhouse gases put into the atmosphere occurred within a single lifetime, and 25% of those emissions were caused by the US. Kens analogy with the cigarettes to the climate crisis revealed to me how important it is to try and lead a more sustainable life to stop the constant cycle contributing to the climate crisis and doing nothing to help prevent it, before it's too late for future generations. It angered me to understand that we have means of stopping this, but because the wealthiest countries are so money hungry, their industries continue to destroy our planet and its resources while blaming the crisis on the countries that not only have no means to fix the problem, but are also contributing far less than the 4% of those who are releasing the majority of carbon emissions.

Thinking about how climate change has been brought about in a single lifetime has a sort of passive effect on me. Wow a "lifetime". So thank you, Ken, for putting that word into a better perspective by using your own life as an example. To know that climate change developed in the time that someone you know has been alive is jarring. It is such a large effect in such a short amount of time.
<br><br>
When Ken talked about the time delay in the effect of climate change on the earth, it reminded me of another analogy I heard about lobsters being boiled. The best way to cook lobster (so I've been told) is to put them into the pot when they're still alive and slowly heat the water until it boils. The lobsters don't even notice that the water around them, their environment, is slowly heating up until it's too late. It's a cruel end for the lobster, but apparently produces the best tasting meat. In the same way the lobsters do not realize what is happening to them until it is too late, the people of the previous generation were unaware of the consequences of their actions.. until now. Luckily, as Ken stated in his video there may be a solution to this horrible problem, and I am optimistic that we can be successful in stopping the effects of climate change from being too devastating (to the point of a mass extinction event).

I agree with you in feeling shocked that the climate crisis has progressed in just a short time of someone's lifetime. It feels so unreal and just makes me even more fearful for how much more will progress in my own lifetime. I, too, remain optimistic that we can do enough to make the inevitable consequences of the climate crisis bearable and avoid the destruction of our planet. I really enjoyed the analogy you introduced as a comparison to the time delay in effects of the climate crisis. I hope we do not meet the same fate as the poor lobsters do; luckily we have the ability to reverse our fate and I truly believe it can be done.

1) Was the film effective at communicating it subject? If so, how did it achieve this?
The film is effectively discussing about the generation issue of the humans on Earth, especially from the prospective of our professor, he talks about his perspective on this topic through his last generation to his next generation, and the impact between it. And the keyword conclusion for it is CUMULATIVE. He uses a very lively instance for it and it’s smoking. He talks about if smoking doesn’t harm you, so you smokes without disciplines, then the effects are actually on your generations and generations of kids, will you smoke again, which simplifies the topic and make people take it more seriously.
<br><br>
2) Who do you think might be the film’s audience? People already concerned about the issue or casual viewers?
The audiences are the youth generation I feel like, since the old generations had “good life” before, and they feel uncomfortable and shamed of simplifying the life. It is the new generation that can possibly have new concept of a good life, it is the new generation that is feeling the changing of the environment. Not only the generations but also between poor and rich countries, US, UK, Russia, combining them together, create 2/3 of the pollution, while the poor countries didn’t actually make many but still suffer from the consequences other countries make.

<p>
"The climate crisis as a generational issue" lecture and the explanation in the lecture "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" discusses how older generations have placed the burden of climate change on younger generations. I think that the first video that introduces how the climate crisis is a generational issue and how the blame can mostly be placed on my parents generation as the ones who have left my generation a planet that is not welcoming and one that is in serious danger of becoming even more damaged as a result of climate change. Although I understand how my parents generations are in the broad scope, more responsible for the climate crisis than my generation, I think that we need to take responsibility for our actions and realize how we also directly contribute to climate change through our everyday actions and subscribing to societal norms that tend to abuse the environment.
<br><br>
In the second lecture video, many interesting points were brought up about climate change and how it relates to generational divides and groups. First off, I found it very logical that the time delay that occurs when experiencing the effects of releasing CO2 into the atmosphere is part of the reason why it has taken humans and generations so long to recognize the problem of climate change as they have neglected the issue for so long. This has resulted in my parents generation and the past 60 years being responsible for most of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In addition, the more developed nations and populations are more responsible for climate change yet they are able to insulate themselves from a good amount of the effects of climate change because of the wealth they have accumulated from the fossil fuel economy while leaving the poorer populations to more directly bear the negative effects of climate change even though these people are far less responsible for the current climate crisis. A point at the end of this lecture that I found specifically interesting was that not only has the generation before me create most of the current climate crisis, they have also failed to train our generation on how to live sustainably and let us fall into the same bad habits that their generation followed that led to abusing the environment. While I think that my generation does need to take responsibility for our own actions and how they've affected the climate, this point really made me realize how much more productive my generation could be if we understood more of how to protect the environment and the climate and how to live more sustainably

<p>
Both lecture videos “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” addressed how the climate crisis stemmed from an older generation that’s still alive, yet the responsibility of fixing our planet has fell on the youths’ shoulders.
<br><br>    In “The climate crisis as a generational issue” it explains how the youth is pissed and riled up that they are left to clean up the mess caused by a generation that was born decades before them. The youth realizes that we need to draw attention to this environmental issue because it’s important for the sake of our future and the later generations that are yet to be born. However, I wonder if the youth is also aware of our own consumption and production. It’s clear that we are more informed on the consequences than older generations were at our age, but how much are we truly doing to make sure we’re not doing the same bad behavioral habits as the generation before us.
    <br><br>As for “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” I mean wow the title is shocking enough. I knew that the problem was increasing rapidly recently, but I didn’t know it all started to rapidly change only 60 years ago. In all honesty, I get why the older generation did what they did, they were releasing a lot of CO2 into the air, but they didn’t see immediate consequences so they thought everything would be fine. It reminds me of a lot of mentalities I’ve witnessed, this idea of pushing to the absolute limit of things in order to receive more of what you want. It astonishes me that in just 60 year time (1959 to 2019) the ppm rose by 100. I’m ashamed that the country I live in is only 4% of the global population yet contributes to 25% of the CO2 in the atmosphere. How can the US be so blind, we are causing so much of the problem and doing nothing about it. But I mean why would they, even though eventually we will feel the impact, we aren’t the ones currently suffering the consequences. The poorest 36 billion people only contribute to 5% of the CO2 in the atmosphere, yet are likely the ones feeling the impacts the most.
</p><hr>
<p>
I think it's ironic that we've been convincing ourselves for a long time that in fact, excessive carbon dioxide emissions will not affect our living environment to a large extent. But this is not the case, because the effects of excessive carbon dioxide emissions are delayed. Imagine that if the delay is 20 years, when the children of our generation grow up, the environment they live in will be seriously affected by the excessive emission of carbon dioxide, and it is not their choice to live in such an environment. Moreover, nowadays excessive carbon dioxide emissions and human activities have shown us some negative effects. Such as the rise of the sea level, the quick extinction of animals. What impresses me most is that in the video, the professor uses people's smoking behavior as a metaphor. If human smoking will affect our health and eventually lead to cancer, then we will enlarge the behavior of human smoking infinitely. Excessive carbon dioxide emission is letting the earth to smoke. Maybe soon the earth will also suffer from cancer, which will be catastrophic and irreversible, so I think we can no longer deceive ourselves. The government and each of us should stand up Protect our environment. Don't let the selfishness of our generation ruin the good living environment of our future generations.
</p><hr>
<p>
The idea that the significant time delay in the effects of the release of CO2 in the air is what brought about the climate crisis makes a lot of sense in my opinion. In comparison, it’s like how people will often procrastinate or choose to neglect their more difficult responsibilities because we find instant gratification in doing something we enjoy at the moment such as watching tv. Delayed gratification is hard to grasp because it’s not tangible right away, in the same way how people can’t comprehend how severe the consequences of the climate crisis will be because it may not seem like it’s directly impacting anyone. It’s furthermore incredibly saddening to know that this concept mainly applies to those more fortunate in developed countries like the United States while developing countries face the most dire consequences of our lifestyles and actions. It’s saddening to know that environmental racism exists and no matter how much science and technology will advance, it will not erase the class and race divides that exacerbate the climate crisis.
<br><br>
People lack understanding of the idea of stewardship and what it means to have your own footprint impact your kin and so on. However, this made my generation more resilient and stronger in our values and determination to ensure that the climate crisis doesn’t get worse than it already is. Part of me worries, but another part of me is excited for this youth movement to ignite the flames and passion in people’s hearts and be the turning point for sustainable living.

In "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime", I found it to be pretty shocking that humans can create such a drastic change to the earth in such a short amount of time. Just the fact that the Earth has remained at a similar PPM level of CO2 for millions of years, but in just a "lifetime" we could spike the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere to dangerous levels. I feel that as humans keep growing in technological development we must be more responsible with the consequences of our growth. The rich in this world are eating up the planet's resources at a much faster rate than the poor. In addition to this, rich countries like the US aren't taking responsibility for the damage they are causing. This was exemplified when the US stepped out of the Paris agreement, practically announcing that climate change was not a top concern for them.
<br><br>
In “The climate crisis as a generational issue”, the issue of the younger generation dealing with the problems caused by the older generations is brought up. While, the reality of this situation is unfortunate, I feel like the older generations are not completely at fault, given that they didn't know the consequences of their actions at that time; it just wasn't common knowledge. However, if they don't adapt to the new flow of information that details the extent of damage out planet might suffer, they're more deserving of critique.

It is shocking and honestly quite frightening to realize how short of a time span that the climate went completely downhill. It’s really eye opening to see what humanity has done in so little time, and understand what a huge impact it will make in the near future. Additionally, it is even more eye opening to realize that we as Americans caused such a large amount of the change that has happened. It is heartbreaking to realize that not only did we cause most of this mess, but we will not even be the ones that will be impacted the most by it. The poorer countries and those in poverty will be the ones to really experience the full misery that this climate change will bring if we do not make a change. If thinking about the future is so frightening to us, it must be so much scarier for those who will not be able to protect themselves as well. 
<br><br>
It is important to realize how fast everything is changing because there is an urgent need to change what we do to change the world. I wish that more people, especially in America, would realize this, and be more involved in wanting to change the environment. Awareness is the first step, and this course being available to the public is a great way to start spreading more awareness for the public who may not know what is going on.

</p><hr>
<p>
I found the video lecture “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single life time” to be quite impactful because it is true many of us late teens and early twenties who will have to take care of this mess have the lowest footprint since many of us don’t even drive and are more eco-friendly than what our parents and grandparents might have been. However, this is not an excuse to just rant while doing nothing, action will me be taken by us I am sure of it since so many of us already have an eco friendly way of thinking and are a constant generation that takes action with movements and walks to get the necessary attention we need. When the politicians who take money from big oil firms see that the nation is switching to renewable energy they will cut off from oil and prioritize in renewable. This is why must act fast on changing the nation’s idea of climate change.
</p><hr>
<p>
As I watched this video, possibly my biggest realization was with regards to the fact that the generational divide of climate change is not just a situational divide of understanding, but one that stems from a relationship with the consequences of climate change. Those in my family who worked in industries that lead to pollution most likely knew that what they were doing was wrong, but they had no sense of consequences nor of the scale of climate change: looking at PPM on a graph is very different from going home for the holidays and learned that it hasn't snowed yet. In a sense I am caught between wanting to blame those who knew that a lifestyle of excess and disregard was wrong, and feeling sympathy for their current predicament as they are likely horrified into apathy by a problem outside of their reach to solve.

I think you made a very interesting point about how the generational divide with respect to climate change is, in many ways, two-sided. I too have wondered how even family members and friends among my parents’ generation surely perpetuated many of the behaviors which we now regard as environmentally damaging. At the same time, many among their generation were also founding members of the modern conservation movement as we know it. My dad, who is about Professor Hiltner’s age, was one of the earliest recipients of an environmental conservation-related degree at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He told me countless stories of his participation in marches, movements, and lobbying for even some of the earliest environmental protection policies in the 1960s and ‘70s. In that sense, I’ve always considered myself relatively lucky to grow up in an environmentally conscious household.
<br><br>
Despite the best efforts of my father and many like him among their generation, though, we now find ourselves in a similar position in a lot of ways. Our economy is still largely dependent on fossil fuels, our consumer culture is generally ignorant of environmentally friendly products (though that trend is turning), and many lawmakers still fight for corporate interests in favor of protecting profits instead of enacting harsh but essential policy to establish lasting change.</span>

After watching lecture video “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, I felt so shock. I only realize the environmental situations are serious. But I never consider this is an outcome that caused by accumulations of generations. It is true that current awful environment is caused by decades damage. If now we do not take actions to alleviate this condition, our planet will get worse and worse. Today, it is a beginning. The earth can not get any injury by human. Frequently forest fires, soil erosion are alarms to us. Our generations need to take responsibility to protect the earth,
</p><hr>
<p>
After watching the lectures “the climate crisis is a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was bought about in a single lifetime,” I can understand why the climate crisis is a generation issue. Due to time delay, people in the past were unable to realize the terrible consequent of using huge amount of fossil fuels. Hence, more and more CO2 was released into atmosphere. As Ken mentioned in his video, CO2 has risen 100 points in 60 years and it can remain in atmosphere for almost 1000 years. As a result of what previous generations have done, we are suffering from the consequences of climate change. So if we don't act quickly, future generations will still suffer. I pretty like Ken’s analogy of smoking cigarettes to explain the relationship between previous generations and their future generations. In order to protect our generations from suffering from impacts of climate change, we should take efficient action immediately and rise the awareness of seriousness of climate crisis.
</p><hr>
<p>
In the first lecture, “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” and “The climate crisis as a generational issue” both do a great job demonstrating how we are in the position that we are in now. Hiltner points out that his generation released excessive amounts of carbon dioxide because they didn’t think that the consequences would ever affect them. However, what they failed to see coming was that the consequences would be affecting their children, grandchildren, and so forth. Hiltner uses the analogy of smoking and having no consequences but having your children and their children be ill from the time that they are born for generations and generations. The United States contributed the most carbon emissions in the world, while being such a small percentage of the overall population. The ppm has increased to 455 and is still on the upwards trend, as some are refusing to see the facts and still convince themselves that climate change is not taking place right in front of their eyes. 
<br><br>
These videos have encouraged me to find the solution to this problem and to help out in any way that I can, because it will be my generation’s problem. We can not allow the ppm to substantially increase anymore because of the dangerous consequences of disease, famine, and burning from the inside out. In order to combat the damage that the previous generation has caused, our generation will be forced to learn to live sustainably if we want even a chance at fixing this problem.
</p><hr>
<p>
Wow. Ken’s apology to our generation was so moving and sincere. I love that. It’s true that his generation has caused this problem and i really gotta give it to him for taking the blame for a whole generation’s mistakes. This video snippet was very informative and thought provoking...

  <span>
I agree! It was touching how he apologized at the end. Yet, I find his efforts to communicate the climate crisis to be a better expression of his sincerity (though I am definitely not saying his apology isn't sincere) than what is briefly shown in the ending of the video. Ken’s actions are an example of one way one person working to solve the climate crisis can positively affect hundreds and thousands of people. I find his dedication rather inspiring. 
<br><br>
The apology also reminds me of a sad truth that often the people who need to apologize the most don’t, and some people take the initiative to apologize when it’s no fault of their own or not really their fault. People with huge carbon footprints could make a larger difference if they reduced their consumption by half compared to those with small footprints. Politicians and other influential people have so much say over what the average person does, but many aren’t willing to work hard and struggle for the climate crisis, while the average person might feel hopeless about their chances to be as influential. Yet, one doesn’t have to be a celebrity or a politician to communicate about the climate crisis. One doesn’t even need to be an adult, as seen through Greta Thunberg’s actions and influence. Also, if everyone helps a bit, then eventually it’ll be a lot. People shouldn’t depend on politicians to do the work, especially since the average person has the ability to influence politics and should value their ability to. It’s honestly a shame that the U.S. isn’t currently doing much despite emitting more carbon than other countries. Based on emissions, the U.S. should be apologizing the most, yet much of our current government is fueled by fossil fuels.  
<br><br>
Although it would be great if everyone was conscious of the environment early on, actions later in life will also give opportunities to contribute, such as through what Ken mentioned near the end of the video. Even if this generation has been raised to live in a way damaging to the environment, it’s still possible to gradually change our generation and future generations. Educating future generations, such as one’s children, to live in a more environmentally conscious way will have lasting effects. Educating others to become more flexible to change would also help them adapt to the necessary changes required to alleviate the climate crisis. 
<br><br><hr><br>
Indeed, I was shocked by how sincere he was when watching the video. And I argued that the expression he had when he apologized communicated and connected with me better than a thousand words. Of course saying how sincere he was doesn't demean the actions he took against climate changes, but it was his sincerity and attitude at that moment was truly the most powerful tool to inspire, at least for me. 
<br><br>
Moreover, as optimistic as I wanted to be, just finding things we didn't do well enough in our daily life doesn't seem to be enough. It is as much as nitpicking compare to the whole industrious system that drive our society, which was in fact the main cause of climate changes. On top of that, politicians were the one who hold the power to decide to  use the cheap but unclean fuels. But just as you said, everyone of us have the ability to influence politics, and I think that's exactly what we should focus beside starting a low-carbon lifestyle.

<p>
Just a few weeks ago I was under the impression that the climate crisis was blown a little out of proportion. I would not have imagined that my country could have contributed roughly a quarter of greenhouse gas emission while half the global population had little to nothing to do with it. I am however extremely optimistic for the future, and I strongly believe that we will make a change in the years to come. This video explains the damage we've done to our habitat in just the past 60 years. At the time, the world was highly convinced that burning fossil fuels and emitting greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere was the way to go. I believe that once the severity of climate change is exposed to the public on a consistent basis, people will begin to take more caution and contribute their part towards a habitable earth. Ken's apology sets a great example for the rest of his generation, and if everyone can own to their mistakes and begin investing in clean energy and plant-based diets, we might save ourselves after all.
</p><hr>
<p>
In the lecture videos “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” and “ the climate crisis as a general issue” details of who caused the crisis and what it really is are given. It is crazy to think that the people who are primarily started the issue will probably not be here to see the destruction. Younger generations will be the ones to suffer the consequences. Not only that but the generation that is guilty is not willing to help. They are in denial that the climate crisis is occurring and believe it is a hoax. They are not willing to help clean up the mess they made leaving the burden to the new generations who will suffer the consequences if action is not taken now. Past generations need to see from the new generations perspective and help in as many ways they can to help change the situation as soon as possible. Knowing that this is a problem that will affect everyone, it is everyone’s duty fault or no fault to take action if order to preserve the earth and survive such dangerous events coming our way.

<p>
I find it very admirable that Professor Hiltner uses his own lifetime as the lifetime of which the entire video refers to. My dad was born shortly after Hiltner, in 1963, and I couldn’t help but think of this the entire video. Just in their short time on earth, they have both seen and inevitably been responsible for contributing to the climate crisis; without fault, their contribution has been a product of the fact they are from the United States. Of course, I say “they” not as a means of singling them out in particular, but rather using them both as pieces of a bigger whole. Hiltner using his own lifetime and generation to put the rapid expansion of CO2 in our atmosphere into perspective is effective at showing the gravity of the issue and how fast it has actually evolved in such a short amount of time. 
<br><br>
It is a shame that only a few countries are the majority producers of CO2 and largest contributors to climate change, despite being relatively small portions of the world’s overall population. Rich, industrialized, and particularly white countries contribute the most and have the least to lose while poor, under-developed (as a result of imperialism and other forms of oppression) countries with populations of color are affected the most. This goes to show that the climate crisis is not an isolated issue, but one intertwined with those such as race, socioeconomic statuses, and capitalism.

<p>
“Delayed impact” is such an important topic of discussion. I feel as if people finding it hard to believe that the consequences one may cause, can and will impact the future. Sometimes it’s not until the effects are show like they are right now with all these hurricanes, droughts and wildfires, where action usually takes place. This is why I believe Professor Ken chiefly highlight the idea of “delayed impact.” Before many of these changes in the climate can be made, we first need to change our way of thinking. We live in not once society, but many that compose what we know as mankind. And these societies also exist in a future time as well. If we don’t change the way we think about climate change, the future, and each other, we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes of our ancestors. Life is not linear. We are still able to branch out into a better future but only if we help each other.

I already knew prior to this that the US emitted LARGE amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere. However, the amount of CO2 that the poorest 3 Billion people put is staggering. You can easily infer it's because we American's consume more than them, but it's much deeper than that. Our capitalist-driven society made us want to consume more and more, causing us to become greedy in resources. A large amount of politicians are pawns of this game, getting bought out by oil company's to deny the issue that is climate crisis; just take a look at our current president.

The way to start is change from legislation. We need vote in people who are pro-activism in climate change. There's still time to reverse the effects, which we are fortunate enough to have. It's also nice to know that there are people that are part of Ken's generation who are/became self-aware of the damage that has been done. Any sort of help in this battle would be beneficial.

In the two assigned lectures, I believe that there are many points made that many climate change deniers tend to neglect or just flat out ignore. In "The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue," you introduce the idea that the fight against the climate crisis has become almost purely an issue being dealt with by the millenial and gen-z generations. This is important to recognize because this is the first movement in human history that is being entirely taken up by one generation. Not only has the movement been sparked by one generation, but they are combatting the consequences caused by one other generation (baby-boomers) that created the problem in the first place. This dynamic has created a stark contrast in beliefs and values between the two generation, which can even be seen in pop culture in todays popular social media platforms.
<br><br>
In the second lecture, I believe the main topic at hand is the loose enforcement of living sustainable lifestyles (along with the alarmingly apparent injustices that countries like the U.S. have created in GHG emissions). Although the behaviors exhibited by previous generations were not believed to be harmful to the environment at the time, it is evident that they have proved to be just the opposite. Previous generations' stubbornness is a large reason why they continue to deny climate change, as they find id difficult to talk down on the way they've been living for decades. By the time everyone realized what these behaviors were doing to our environment, it was too late. Now present and future generations must suffer from their actions, and it is up to us to fix it.
</p><hr>

<p>
The lecture "The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue" confirmed my thoughts about exactly that. I have not always thought of it as so, it has only been recently (with increasing media coverage on climate justice) that I have become more aware.
<br><br>
I believe that our biggest issue today is human greed. I was reminded of this when you mentioned cigarettes and doing something that does not have consequences for you, but rather for someone else. Human greed is the reason climate change deniers exist. Yes, I know that people in older generations may not have known what they were getting themselves into in the beginning, but now we DO know. Everyone knows. Yet, many humans are too attached to their material possessions and too busy reaching for that thing that brings them euphoric pleasure that they do not have the self-control to change their toxic actions. Changing means saving their offspring and their offspring's offspring... but even that is too tough. I feel sympathetic towards all of the human race (including myself) for this greed, but I also know it is possible to overcome it. How? I don't know. Somebody might have the self-control to figure that out, but getting people to pay attention is a whole other story.
</p><hr>

<p>
First of all, I would also like to apologize for never putting efforts in self-educating about ways to fight climate changes, I am sorry.
<br><br>
To be honest, I understood very well that only significantly bad consequences would come with the current mode of our society and industries, yet I chose to stay silent, ignoring what's happening and what will be the terrifying future for our next generations. Sometimes human can be very selfish, and it's the exactly the selfishness of human being that caused the climate changes in the first place. And shameful to admit, I am the selfish type of person. The next generation or so called future never seemed to be relevant to me as I don't exist in the future. I used to think that as long as I am enjoying what my life is offering me, who cares? 
<br><br>
But who ever gave me rights to take away others' rights to enjoy the same Earth? Nobody did, and I shall be continuing to feel shameful for recklessly seeking luxuries at the cost of the health of this planet. Your video along with "The climate crisis as a generational issue" didn't just educate me about more worryings regarding climate changes in general, it also inspires me to start doing something meaningful, something worth more to fight for, not just some temporary enjoyments from material life. Because I couldn't help to ask myself after watching your videos: if I truly have an enjoyable experience as I live, what reasons do I have to not appreciate it? I told myself that life is indeed short and temporary, but that's exactly what make protecting the home for next generation meaningful, because only then this joy I want to share can have a chance to be pass on to the future, some time my life won't reach.
<br><br>
Ken, I am truly thankful for what you are doing for our Earth, I will also try to do the same in my own way to make a difference.
</p><hr>

<p>
I was a little surprised to find out how recently the climate problem started to develop, especially that those responsible for it are still alive today. I assumed that the problem began around the Industrial Revolution era and continued to grow worse from there, but such an enormous impact was made on the planet in such a short timespan. The rise from 315 ppm to 415 ppm since 1959 is drastic, and the rate it is rising will only increase. It is especially frustrating that the wealthiest countries in the world - who have contributed the most to this problem and continue to do so today - won’t feel the negative consequences of it. Instead, the poorer people, who have contributed only 5% of total carbon emissions, will suffer. Oil companies and politicians that abuse their power absolutely should be the ones apologizing for refusing to even consider climate change as an issue, but hopefully my generation will be the one to fight back against this injustice and corruption.
<br><br>
The analogy about how smoking cigarettes will harm your children even if you’re not harmed is a great way to describe the climate crisis. Those that are causing the problem will most likely not be around long enough to see the problem actually arise, but their children will be forced to clean up the mess that the previous generation created. It is particularly unfair because of the generational gap; while the younger generation is quicker to believe climate change is real and more actively fighting to make sustainable changes, the generation that caused these problems refuse to change their ways, thereby worsening the problem that we will have to solve.
</p><hr>

<p>
I find it pretty upsetting that we are taking this planet for granted: polluting it and using up the fossil fuels just so that a small portion of the world population, not even half, can enjoy. I used to envy the rich and wondered how it would be to live such luxurious lifestyles, yet I never stopped to think that the people in third world countries are most likely wishing for a life like mine. I'm able to watch these videos and be educated of what is going on however they don't have the access and privileges that I do, yet they still have to endure most of the pain and suffering. The amount of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere is increasing like crazy and I am both truly scared and sorry for the rest of the world and for myself for the actions that were caused by the people from the United States
<br><br>
It is true that the planet is slowly dying and this "time delay" that was mentioned in the video is playing a huge part in the denial of our older generations. They're filled with greed and pride and only care about themselves and I feel that they know this is not going to affect them. It is going to be too late before everyone come to the same terms and have a general idea about what is going on and actually trying to help reduce emissions. I am glad that there is still time to act and I will encourage others to do the same.
</p><hr>

<p>
In these two lecture videos, I got a new perspective on the climate crisis than I had before. The first video made me feel very proud that my generation is not letting the failures of our predecessors keep us from taking action. We are not staying silent and are doing almost all that we can to keep the planet alive. With our current political climate being as juxtaposed as it has been, I am surprised and glad to see such a large group of people ignore their differences to come together for the same common goal. In order to fix the problems that we face, it must be a team effort. We have shown that, despite being ridiculed by older generations on our lack of focus, we are capable of making changes in society.
<br><br>
The second video made me think a lot more about my actions, as they impact more people than just myself. It really made me feel a sort of guilt towards the future children of this world that, up to this point, I have largely not done my part in helping out the cause against the climate crisis. I think Ken's apology at the end of "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" hits the right point. I can see the logic behind the older generations setting the climate crisis into action knowingly, but I do not appreciate how we have been allowed to stay on this track and make the same mistakes that they made. I am hopeful that our children will be in a world where their parents will teach them to appreciate the planet they live on and take great care of it.
</p><hr>

<p>
Ken mentioned that the ones who caused this damage are still alive as well as still contributing to climate crisis. This baffled me because it really made me realize how true it is when Ken says that all of this irreversible damage was all done in one lifetime. It saddens me to think about the fact that my future children and future grandchildren will have to suffer from something myself and many others caused. It's very unfair too. They will have to suffer with potential diseases and cancers just from existing in a world that is deteriorating. What did they do to deserve to suffer in a world that they will only wish was a better quality of life. Even undeveloped parts of the world that haven't contributed to the destruction of our habitat will have to suffer. They will have to suffer for decades for something they didn't do. This lecture sparked an interest for myself in getting more involved in politics and do my research. My next priority is learning about who stands for our health and the health of our earth when it comes to fossil fuels and decreasing its addition to causing climate change among many other factors.
</p><hr>

<p>
I really liked the example Ken used with the cigarettes and thought it was really accurate to show how the climate crisis was caused by the generation before us and how it is going to affect my generation, my children, and my grandchildren.  I can't believe that three-quarters of all the co2 put in the atmosphere was put there in a single lifetime, and it blows my mind that 66% of all emissions were put there by developed countries; why are we not held more accountable?  It makes me sad that even though most third world countries (3 billion people!) are only putting out 5% of all carbon emissions, yet they are the ones that are suffering the most, and are going to be most affected by the results of the climate crisis.   Most undeveloped countries live on or near the equator, which is going to be affected the most by rising temperatures.  It's very frightening to think that more carbon was put into the atmosphere in a single lifetime of the generation before me than was put there by the entire human race.  I hope that I can, and my generation, learn from the mistakes of our parents and hopefully start to move towards a more sustainable future.  The thing that frightens me the most is one of the points that Ken made; his generation is leaving us a world that is very near to becoming inhospitable for the human race, and races a very shocking, but important question; if we continue on the way that we are living without a radical change happening, will my children even have a planet to live on?
</p><hr>

<p>
I've always been concerned about global warming. In my AP Environmental Science class I learned about the dire consequences of an increase in temperature in the world's climate and it made me want to help try to reverse the damage. I knew that humans were at fault for this anthropogenic global warming. However, I never thought to place the blame on one generation. I feel as though it is not the baby boomers' fault that our planet is becoming uninhabitable. It is the human races' fault as a whole. 
<br><br>
Humans are complex organisms: they have the ability to advance modern technology, and they have the innate desire to create more, obtain more, and give more. With technology, humans can more easily acquire the world's resources, which enrich our lives in many ways (food, shopping, traveling, housing, etc). Just as humans are strong enough to ruin the planet, they are strong enough to repair it.
<br><br>
I still don't think that the problem had a generational origin. However, Ken's apology made me really think about the control the baby boomer generation had over the situation of climate change. Although the baby boomer generation failed to recognize environmental issues, I feel as though it is a good thing that the control was within reach at all. Global warming isn't something that will end all life on earth, no matter what. It is something that can be stopped. Surely, stopping it requires a lot of effort and it would've been easier if we had started earlier, but I believe that humans can do it. Even if they don't start now or anytime soon, they will eventually. Like I said, humans have the innate desire to create, obtain, and give. Humans will not give up. They are stronger than the species that have gone extinct in the past and their minds are far more complex. Humans will fight to live, and make drastic changes if necessary.
</p><hr>

<p>
What do we do when those primarily responsible for this drastic change in CO2 levels in the atmosphere don't seem to care about future generations? It is so incredibly frustrating to see so many be completely unbothered by the harm they have caused to future generations, because they believe they won’t be there to experience the worst of the worst, without even realizing that they’re living it. I knew that the States was contributing heavily to the amount of CO2 emissions being released into the atmosphere, but after hearing that they are responsible for a quarter of all the CO2 in the atmosphere, whilst their population is just 4 percent is a very hard pill to swallow, and I’m not even American. It gets even worse when you come to find that 3 billion of the poorest people on earth contribute only 5% really brings forth the injustice of the whole situation. I think it was really important that Professor Hiltner emphasized that they would most likely than not experience these consequences at a higher intensity than the developed world, merely because the developed world is able to benefit economically from destroying our planet. I was extremely frustrated to learn of this statistic, because it makes the US’s decision to back out of important initiatives like the Paris agreement so much harder to comprehend. It feels like the biggest slap in the face to any other country, as if America should not be held accountable to fix a problem that they so intensely contributed to. I fear that this issue will not be taken as seriously as it needs to be until it is too late.

Through watching this video, an interesting pattern has become clear to me. In order for people to create a better life for themselves and their family, people turned to fossil fuels. Fossil fuels have been a great form of temporary success, however soon the detrimental environmental impacts will outweigh that success. In order for people to be well off, they turn to fossil fuels, which will make the future worse for their families. Additionally, those who have thrived through fossil fuels, such as the U.S., will have the effects of climate change mitigated for longer in comparison to those who don't abuse fossil fuels, such as Africa.This negative cycle encourages the climate crisis going on now. If the new generation doesn't decide to make a difference and break the cycle, we are no better than the generations before us who have created and integrated this cycle into society. We know better than to continue down this path, we must create a new society that provides environmental justice to everyone.

I just want to add on to this because I think you make a very good point. Us as Americans don't really feel much of the effects of climate change yet, at least not as aggressively as in other places of the world. It may be because we live in a bubble, or because as you said, we have been burning fossil fuels and exploiting natural resources for generations just so that we could live comfortably. This life style of comfortability is cemented into our culture, but as harmful as it may be to our earth, I don't think we will break any cycle. Nobody wants to be uncomfortable. Professor Ken is right in saying that we need to make radical changes in order to save the planet. But it think that those radical changes have to be almost entirely focused on our lifestyle/habits. Collectively, we have to demonstrate an interest in a sustainable and eco friendly way of life because if we do that, then companies and politicians will be forced to cater to that demand. Like, remember when fidget spinners came out. It was like an overnight explosion and suddenly there where all these different companies selling fidget spinners. Now imagine if we could have that same push for public transportation here in the U.S.. The video talks about CO2 emissions and how harmful it is to our planet, but I think that a driving force in CO2 emissions is the ginormous consumption addiction we have as a culture. 
<br><br>
On a side note, I would like to point out that your comment was one of the more engaging comments on here. I truly believe that masquerading in fanciful wording does us no good. On a subject as serious and complex as climate change, playing around with eloquent writing that sounds textbook material just makes this topic all the less engaging. There is a serious disconnect in communication between the scientist that publishes an article acknowledging climate change and the layperson who dismisses it because they didn't sign up to read Infinite Jest.

These lecture videos allowed me to reflect on the climate crisis in a new way. I feel as though many people are waiting to take action and join the environmentalist movement, and I have often lost focus on the climate crisis because it didn’t seem to be a pressing issue. Watching these lectures, however, I can see that we are running out of time to act and there is no better time to change than the present. I found Ken’s cigarette analogy to be fascinating and accurately summed up the reasons in which this issue was not dealt with sooner. Because the effects of humanity’s crimes against our earth were not immediate, I can understand how the boomer generation did not understand the severity of the issue. Today, however, the impacts on our environment are more evident than ever, and will only worsen without immediate action. I have never before considered why prevention of the climate crisis was not prevalent before recent years, but I feel as though I now understand how this issue has been put off for so long. I hope that my generation does not make these same mistakes, as we have now grown up with the climate crisis as our reality, and the world is not going to fix itself without intensive intervention. I am inspired by Ken’s words, as he is able to acknowledge the issues caused by his generation and even apologizes for it. I appreciate those individuals from his generation who are now aiming to prevent any further destruction of our environment, instead of solely relying on more recent generations to fix an issue that we did not cause. Another point brought up in these lectures that stuck out to me is the fact that, although most of the climate crisis is a result of only 4% of the population, the least privileged individuals will likely face the most severe consequences as a result of climate change. This fact is incredibly disheartening to me and, in my opinion, should be one of the most substantial reasons to take action against climate change. Although the climate crisis will eventually have a detrimental impact on our entire planet, the most privileged and wealthy individuals will likely be the last to face its effects, despite having a major role in the destruction of the environment. Although I am often saddened by the facts behind climate change, seeing all of the comments on these videos as well as student activism gives me hope that my generation and others before us can help in restoring our environment and ending the destruction.

I found the analogy used for cigarette smoking to be very informative of how the world, specifically the U.S behaves today. I believe we have a very single minded, reactive approach when it comes to many issues such as climate change. Instead, we need to be proactive as the real devastation of what we are causing will not be fully realized for a couple of more years.   I think many view climate change through a very selfish approach. By that I mean that they do believe in climate change but are thinking they can't do much to change it at the moment and that someone in the future will solve that problem. Our reactive mindset causes us to believe that we will deal with a way to survive once the full impacts of climate change are felt. This idea is flawed because there is no guarantee that some genius will arrive with a full proof solution to save humanity once it's too late, while also allowing millions to suffer and die along the way. My perspective is why should we find out how to stop a disaster if we already have solutions in preventing the disaster. Humanity as a whole needs to break its addiction to fossil fuels and learn that our consumption today is not okay. Back to the cigarettes idea analogy, eventually we need to see the harmful health risks and possible death that comes with smoking cigarettes(using fossil fuels) and break our addiction. In terms of harming our future generations, however, we do not even need to look that far. In a sense, smaller countries compared to developed ones like the U.S serve the same idea of harming our future kids who have done little to nothing wrong. These smaller countries don't pollute nearly close to the amount of the U.S, yet they are the ones suffering while we continue to live our high consumption filled lives. I believe we wouldn't continue to pollute so freely if we suffered the same consequences as less fortunate countries. The world's polluters need to wake up before we realize that its too late and begin to suffer the wrath of our own actions.

After watching Ken’s video, it amazes me how so much pollution has been caused in just one generation of people. Ken explains it very well when he compares pollution to smoking. Its true if you could do something all you want with no consequences but that doesn’t mean others will not suffer. Generations and generation of people, animals, and plants all suffer from this one generation of polluters. It’s sad that the ones who cause the pollution will not have to deal with the consequences and may not even be alive to see what they have done. To make matters worse the 3 billion people who had a minor impacted on the worlds pollution will have to deal with the worse consequences. It made me very sad to learn from this video that the ocean has absorbed  quarter of the CO2 that has been emitted through this one lifetime. These poor animals must suffer from the mistakes made by people.

When the band Busted sang the lyrics “I’ve been to the year 3000, not much has changed but they live underwater, and your great great great grandaughter, is pretty fine…” they got one thing right and one thing wrong; yes, we will probably be underwater, but no, your great great great grandaughter probably isn’t fine, in fact she’s probably still suffering the effects of climate change that were brought upon by her ancestors. The lectures “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” are both great videos which clarify how the climate crisis emerged and why it continues to be a problem passed down to younger generations. To begin, I’d like to say how admirable I think it is that Ken apologized on behalf of his generation. As someone who is part of generation Z, it’s not uncommon for me to hear comments made by older generations complaining about us being ‘whiners,’ ‘liars,’ or just kids who don’t know what they’re talking about. It is infuriating to hear and see these comments on a frequent basis all the while knowing that my generation is going to have to deal with the very real consequences of climate change first hand. Obviously no one likes to admit to their mistakes, but if older generations can finally accept that 1.) climate change is real, and 2.) their generation perpetuated toxic and unsustainable practices, then we can finally address the problem directly instead of continuing to deflect blame and point fingers at one another. 
<br><br>
It does not surprise me whatsoever that the United States has emitted ¼ of all CO2 in the atmosphere, or that developed countries will be able to protect themselves from the effects of climate change with the money made off of the fossil fuel industry. The wealth that developed countries have accrued through environmental destruction allows leaders in those countries to turn a blind eye at the consequences because they do not see it as a direct threat, whereas third world countries will and are suffering more than they ever have as a result of climate change. It is imperative that we continue to educate the masses about climate change, and what we as individuals can do to combat the climate crisis.
</p><hr>

<p>
This video and "The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue" really shocked me when discussing how the current climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime. Even though the past generation has brought about this crisis, it is up to our generation to fight for a solution. Clearly much of the damage is irreversible but halting the climate crisis is up to us. Especially as college students, where we come from a place of privilege where we have access to higher education and we have the time and energy to spend on creative climate solutions. It is the job of the developed countries, who have contributed the most to this crisis, to contribute the most to the solution.
</p><hr>

<p>
The lectures “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” introduce the climate crisis through a generational lens. It is interesting to think of how the climate crisis has gotten to this point for the most part in just less than a lifetime. It demonstrates how the misconception of no consequences enabled the developed world to keep on pushing and pushing on pollution. It is only now that consequences are more severe and obvious that climate change activism is building momentum and gaining attention. I also found the notion that our generation has been raised into an addiction to fossil fuel interesting because although we have only known and enjoyed the conveniences made possible by fossil fuel, it is our generation that is taking a stand and realizing that these conveniences are not worth the destruction of our planet. A great injustice is that the United States is accountable for 1/4 of the carbon dioxide in the air, whereas the poorest 3 billion people are only accountable for 5%, yet they are the ones more susceptible to the consequences of climate change. This demonstrates how carbon dioxide emission levels greatly differ among the population of the earth. It means that carbon dioxide emission levels can be decreased in the United States by making lifestyle changes.

<p>
“The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue” and “How the Climate Crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” were insightful and directed my attention to the vast amounts of damage we have made to the world in such a short period of time. The point was brought up that the US makes up 1/4 of all global CO2 emissions despite only being 4% of the world’s population, yet despite that, we do not want to change the heavy industrial processes that just add onto these emissions. We are so obsessed with being the number one superpower in the world that we don’t even see we are the main ones destroying it. 
<br><br>
It confuses me that there are still people amongst my generation who want to so adamantly deny that climate change is in motion. It could be that they are following what the previous generation also wants to believe, but it is our responsibility to make them see the facts and have them join our fight to change the way we are living. The way we live now is unacceptable.
</p><hr>

<p>
In the video “How the Climate Crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, I find the parable of second hand smoke and contaminating water to releasing CO2 to the atmosphere is quite convincing. When polluting our atmosphere, we hardly see what influence it puts on our climate. However, with time passing by, our offsprings will suffering from what we have done, just like second hand smoke. And the more pollution there is, the more our offsprings will suffer. And another facts that mentioned in the video is the nation that has the most pollution is the United States, which reminds me of the fact Ken mentioned in his lecture that even though developed countries are the main contributors to pollution, but developing countries are the ones who need to pay. Thus, I think it is everyone’s responsibility to take action to saving our planet. We should never let our offsprings or others to pay for our debts.

I came back to watch this video to study for our midterm, and I picked up on a fact that I hadn't before. Before, I was shocked to hear that for the majority of human history, CO2 levels have hovered around 280 ppm, and today they have risen to 415 ppm, with 100 of it being in the last 60 years. This is crazy. However, what I didn't realize was that Ken said the 415 ppm would be much higher because our oceans have absorbed around a quarter of the CO2 we've emitted. Had the oceans not been as large, we would have seen a much larger increase in CO2 levels, leading to even harsher effects. 415 ppm is crazy enough as is, and thinking that it could have been much worse is insane.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching the two videos I can’t help but feel a desire to be seen for the rest of the time and to be seen in history as the ‘generation that saved the planet’, the ones that rectified all the mistakes the preceding generations made. However, it is also apparent that the contemporary society as we have known it for the entirety of our lives is essentially set up in a way that blockades any real progress from happening. The most powerful individuals on the planet are publicly mocking this generation’s efforts to make the earth more inhabitable and as long as the power remains with those that have the most money (fossil fuel industry and politicians that support them) there is seldom going to be any progress made pertaining the climate crisis. It is also frightening how those responsible for the crisis have little to no remorse about the gravity of the negative externalities their actions are causing. Despite this, our generation, especially in the developed parts of the world have considerably become part of the problem instead of the solution. While we are not the ones burning fossil fuels or contributing in that manner, we seldom participate in harmful activities, such as purchasing single-use plastics, supporting the main-stream fashion industry and many many more. In my opinion, the main way forward is for my generation to put the blame and crippling hatred aside, and for the preceding generation to holistically comprehend the extremity of the situation and for us to both come together and work at finding a plausible solution that will not only work for now but also for the next hundreds of years.

Both “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” discuss the generational injustice posed to us: we are left to deal with problems created by the previous generation and an economy built upon fossil fuels. However, the real victims of the climate crisis also include the poor countries that will be extremely vulnerable to the ramification of climate change as they lack the economy and infrastructure to prevent or remediate climate change. According to the video “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” approximately half of the world’s population will have to suffer from effects of climate change contributed by three major countries. Not only did the previous generation that heavily relied on fossil fuel and heavy eco-footprint lifestyle leave this problem to our generation, but it is already starting to affect other populations of the previous generation.

The lectures “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” both accurately summarize the issues that not only our generation faces in regards to the climate crisis, but the generations to come. The buildup of atmospheric CO2 from pre industrial times until now has left us in a difficult predicament, with action needed now. While the demise of our climate seems out of sight out of mind for our generation, we are not the ones that will be most greatly affected it will be the ones to come. The use of the cigarette smoking analogy really puts this crisis into perspective because our future generations are most likely going to be the ones most effected. With how we have been treating climate change now, it will be hard to look our kids in the eyes and tell them that at least we really truly tried to salvage their futures. Yes, there is already significant damage done, but that does not mean it is completely irreversible, if we want to save the future we must act now.

In the lectures “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, Hiltner talks about the climate crisis we are experiencing, how it came about, and the importance of the youth rebelling and being concerned with this problem. I truly appreciated Ken’s apology at the end of the video after holding his generation accountable for their contribution to this frightening climate crisis. I appreciated this because for many years I have heard older generations dismiss the impacts of the climate crisis as if they are not important because it won’t affect them, including family members. Ken apologizing  gives me hope that more people also feel the same way he does and seek to find ways to take action and change climate denier perspectives. 
<br><br>
One specific thing that is quite alarming about the lecture “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” is the pie chart that demonstrated the CO2 emitted by the developed world. The U.S. is responsible for ¼ of the emitted CO2, and if you add the countries that make up Europe, and Russia, in total they are all responsible for 66.67% of all the emitted CO2 in the atmosphere. It’s alarming because they only make up ⅛ of the total world’s population. On the other hand, the poorest 3 billion people in the world only make up 5% of the total emitted CO2 in the atmosphere. This is alarming because they will suffer the consequences the most, however, the developed world will be protected because the wealth and power awarded from fossil fuels. This is selfish and wrong and immediate action needs to occur now. This lecture video made me also question my actions, it made me realize that I act without considering that my actions might have an impact on other individuals, even if it is not much of an impact in my life. I also tend to act in selfish ways and it made me realize I need to acknowledge the possible impacts my actions have on the world. It’s important to hold everyone accountable for their actions and negative contributions to the climate crisis, including our own.

<p>
In a single video, I have learned more about our climate crisis than throughout my whole life. It's terrifying that the situation our planet faces is only being taken seriously by a small portion of those who primarily caused it. When it was presented that the U.S., Europe, and Russia are solely responsible for nearly 2/3 of all the CO2 in the atmosphere, I was left speechless. In a single lifetime, by those who came before us, CO2 has risen 100 ppm; we are definitely nature's best creation. We who believe are superior to every other race in the animal kingdom, with our vast useless knowledge and inflated ego; have doomed everyone to the planet's sixth mass extinction. As I type "we," I refer to those who run the first world countries. Those who refuse to acknowledge that our world is dying, to those that are too old to care because they won't be here for the aftermath of their actions, to those that only see green; green dollar signs that have blinded them from all reason.  
<br><br>
The comparison that was made using cigarettes was also very helpful, it helps those who don't have a great understanding of the topic grasp the concept. It may also convince older people to change and act for their loved ones' future. Some people just need to feel the fear most of the youth has when it comes to climate change; they must feel that their lives will also be affected in order to act. 
<br><br>
Lastly, I would like to thank professor Ken for his words at the end of this video. To know that there are people in the older generation who feel our anguish gives us hope; hope that we are not too late and that our voices are being heard.
</p><hr>

<p>
It is inspiring to hear that there is something that we can still do to relieve the climate crisis, although I understand that in order to get there, we will have to entirely redefine our lives. I often wonder how we allowed climate change to advance at such an alarming rate. Did we not see the signs? Did we not care? It is amazing how facts and science can be ignored for the sake of remaining guilt free. It is hard to accept that it really IS as bad as “they” are making it seem, and honestly probably worse.  
<br><br>
Unfortunately, even though many of us are already there, there is still a great majority that refuses to accept the severity of climate change. If we cannot get people to believe it, we cannot get them to start making changes. I like to think that I am doing a pretty good job at doing my part in the climate crisis, but I too often feel that I am not doing enough. Hearing the terrifying statistics make me feel quite honestly useless. The truth is, we cannot make a significant change as individuals. It takes numbers. It takes joint effort. My changes in lifestyle may be insignificant when standing alone, but they could be incredibly effected if practiced by the masses. Of course, it will probably be a long time before we get there. But that is exactly what we don’t have: time. 
<br><br>
Overall, I think it is necessary to alarm people, scare them into making change. However, it is also important to reiterate that there is still hope, and our actions still have the potential of making a change.
</p><hr>

<p>
In this video, Professor Hiltner's message about CO2 increasing by 100ppm in his lifetime so far that significantly influenced people's life. Though human had made such "great" contribution to the environment of the earth and main contributors are U.S. and European countries, it is unfair to limit countries which haven't even polluted the earth yet because the right to emit greenhouse gas is equal to the right of developing from my perspective.  
<br><br>
If we look through history, there has never been a country that could complete industrialization without emits CO2. Emitting greenhouse gas is the way that a Country must take if it wants to succeed in the earth while having enormous pressure from the outer lands that prohibit any emission of greenhouse gas. Developed countries must let those developing countries keep their developing, and developed countries shall work on the way to save humans instead of prohibiting other countries from developing.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching both lecture videos, “The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue” and “How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime”, I gained even more respect for Professor Ken for apologizing on behalf of his generation, and I hope other adults could recognize the huge impact and complex problems their generation has made for younger generations to deal with. During “How the Climate Crisis was Brough in a Single Lifetime” and being informed of the immense levels of CO2 that older generations emitted in such a short amount of time is alarming. It is also alarming that the United States is a huge contributor to these rising CO2 emissions when we don’t even have the largest population. I find it so sad that developing countries are the ones who have to suffer the consequences due to developed countries’ mistakes. This can be related back to the way younger generations have to struggle as generations before them left them with the mess to clean up. 
<br><br>
After watching the lecture video “The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue”, I felt that the world has hope with these newer generations of activists. We are advocating for a change and we believe that we can do it. Taking the time to make posters, marching and speaking out, and getting our voices heard around the world shows the determination and motivation we have to reverse the problems caused by others years and years ago.
</p><hr>

<p>
I’ve never truly understood how climate change became a problem. I have heard of the issue my entire life, but I have never questioned how exactly it began. Both lecture videos, “The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue”, and “How the climate crisis was brought in a single lifetime”, presented information that served in answering the questions I never realized I have about climate change. The passion so many people of my generation have about this topic led me to assume throughout my life that we were the problem, when really, as these lecture videos stated, the climate change we now deal with today is the result of mistakes made by people generations ago. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately, because these mistakes were not clear until decades later, my generation and I now live with the consequences they brought forth. Although we may not be the one’s responsible for it, we do contribute to the issue as a whole by the way we have become accustomed to live our lives. So many of the actions we take, without realizing it, have caused the issue of climate change to grow. For these reasons, I understand why people feel so passionate about doing something to stop this continuous growth. I now understand this situation as one that can not be fixed overnight, but instead something we must work toward improving over time for the sake of future generations to come. Seeing how fast climate change has grown throughout the last few decades worries me about what could be in store if change is not made soon. What truly astonishes me about climate change, is how much I did not know about it prior to watching these lectures. This information is vital for everyone to know, especially those in the U.S., in order to understand why climate change is such a problem, and why we should prepare to take action to improve it.
</p><hr>

<p>
Both videos “The climate crisis as a general issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” both discuss how our parents, grandparents, and generations before us have ruined the planet for us. As Hiltner said we are angry that generations before us did nothing to help reverse climate change when they knew that it would be a problem. Ken’s analogy with the cigarettes was very helpful to put everything into perspective. The generation before us may have not been affected by this but now our generation and our children will suffer greatly form climate change if nothing is done about it. Greenhouse gases are a major contributor to climate change and just within a life time carbon dioxide PPM has increased from 315 to 415. What can we expect in the next decade or two? Not only are the PPM of CO2 are going to increase but they will increase at a rapid rate, so if we do not do anything now then we really will have an uninhabitable planet.
</p><hr>

<p>
These lecture videos further instilled many of the lessons we learned in lecture. However, the addressing of the generational gap of climate crisis awareness by Ken was very reassuring, in that as much support as possible is needed for young climate crisis activists. The consistent and accelerating release of greenhouse gases into our atmosphere is a dire issue that needs to be addressed and not ignored like it has been for the past 50 years. With now up to 415 ppm of carbon dioxide and it being the leading cause of climate crisis, there is an obvious problem that needs to be addressed now and our generation is doing so. It is very apparent that we are harming our planet with all this carbon dioxide, and we are not slowing. Specifically, massive oil companies and industrial powerhouses are producing the heavy majority of this harm with various forms of carbon dioxide release, yet they feel no need to stop because that would mean less money. They make money from massive animal farms which release methane and from the absurdly powerful oil industries. But what is a fortune without a planet left to spend it on?
</p><hr>

<p>
I apologize, firstly, for a very emotionally driven comment: Today after Lecture and after watching this lecture video, I feel both despair and anger at the American people, myself included. I have been impacted by the stats on the extinct species and the devastation brought by the actions of the recent past and the horrible repercussions that they will have on our future for many generations to come. In honesty, there have been days when I wished that the generation that initiated this holocaust would lose all power and today is one of those days that I feel that strongly. I feel that I have very little hope with the lack of breadth of influence that I have to make any change over the world. I am convinced that the Western lifestyle is one that devalues life for money and it depresses me. The shame is that even though we have the power, collectively, to mitigate and derail this chaos train, we still lack drive. It’s heart-breaking to realize that we are causing mass-destruction for a social construction that we value to the level of a deity. I want nothing more than to wake up from this nightmare and stop it before it becomes reality again.

</p><hr>

<p>
It is a great injustice that has been committed to the majority of this planet by the few. We were taught that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few but when we look in the reality of modern life, the needs of the few (the wealthy) triumphs over the needs of the majority. Looking at the science and current trajectory of many nations, we will inevitably reach one of the many tipping points leading to a positive feedback loop that will take this problem and make it the end of humanity. 
<br><br>
Our salvation lies with the one area of human knowledge that has caused our worst problems and then subsequently solved them: science. In the United States, we have two different views on climate change and this polarization on basic science will lead to nothing being done in the long term. But, on the other hand, there is a very powerful and very motivated scientific discourse community that recognizes the problems and lack of solutions and has set out to innovate their own in a controversial new field of science known as geoengineering. It saddens me deeply to think that we will have to resort to highly experimental and untested science if we are to save our planet. But in the end, the greed that has gotten us to this situation is too strong for us to overcome without resorting to desperate and dangerous methods.
</p><hr>

<p>
What started off as a lecture filled with qualms about the older generation causing these problems in our climate and ended with an apology from our professor himself served to show that there are people out there who are still looking out for the preservation of the Earth. We see that a quarter of CO2 emissions have been from the US even though the US only makes up about 4% of the world population which is something that is a major problem. This is something that should not be happening. It pains me to see that the people who live in first world countries put out the most CO2 emissions and are directly impacting the climate are those who are the least affected. Those living in third world conditions are being impacted in their daily life and we are not doing anything significant enough to solve this problem. 
<br><br>
Using the smoking analogy was a complete hit with the audience I feel like because everyone knows the consequences of cigarettes and it shows that even though we may not be feeling the consequences, the next generations will. This shows that as long as we do these negative things, everyone in subsequent generations will be affected and this in turn may influence the next generation to take everything for granted and do these things too.
<br><br>
From what I can see, the next generation, me included, have developed much stronger feelings about saving the environment than the other generations because like Professor Hiltner said, we were born into this. Because of that we must do the best that we can in order to live a better life on an Earth that will be inhabitable. In doing so, we are able to preserve the Earth for the next generations to come.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching “The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue” and “How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime”, I have slightly more hope for the future. Hiltner reminded the viewers of the growing activism for climate justice and how new generations are standing up for positive change. His smoking analogy resonated with me strongly, as one person’s choice to smoke can ruin the lives of others. Climate change has this same effect, with even worse consequences. Learning that CO2 has increased 100 ppm in only 60 years is disappointing and frightening. Learning about the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere has made me motivated to change how I live my life, as I don’t want future generations to have to deal with the effects. 
<br><br> 
These videos also reminded me that climate change is a social justice concern, as everyone pays the consequences, while the rich just abuse their powers. Hiltner discussed that the developed world, which is only 1/8th of the world’s population, has contributed 66.67% of CO2. When developed countries, such as the United States, use fossil fuels and contribute to greenhouse gases, they are knowingly harming poorer countries who have to cope with the problems that follow. These facts and data have enraged me, motivating me to want to get more involved in solving the issue of climate change. We cannot sit around and let those around the world suffer the consequences, as we continue to turn a blind eye.

</p><hr>

<p>
The video “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” highlights some important facts about the climate crisis. One of the most tragic facts is how the poorest people contribute a very low amount to the climate crisis yet they are the ones most at risk to its effects. You’d think those  with more recourses would focus on tackling the actions in their lives that contribute heavily to the climate crisis but they largely don’t. Instead many downplay its effects, don’t care, or don’t believe in the climate crisis at all. We don’t dispute the theory of gravity becuase it’s part of the human experience. Everyone in this earth has dealt with gravity. For climate change deniers and those who are generally apathetic to the crisis, the climate crisis isn’t their reality. They generally have the material recourses to not be affected by the climate crisis as the poor and for this old enough it never will be. This is upsetting as their all consuming lifestyles are a major reason for the crisis in the first place.
</p><hr>

<p>
I found the analogy of the cigarette smoking to the effects of climate change on the next generation very interesting. It made it very clear what is going on and how this will affect those of the future, and made this argument in a very unique and successful way.
</p><hr>

<p>
The idea of climate injustice deeply resonated with me after watching the two lecture videos by Professor Hiltner. People living in developed countries are enjoying resources for demanding lifestyles while people in developing countries are suffering the bitter consequences of climate change. It shocked me the most when learning that solely 4% of the world’s population is capable of contributing 25% of the global carbon emission, while the poorest 3.6 billion of people in the developing nations only makeup of 5% of emission, which is such an insignificant number comparing to this massive population that uses “billion” as a unit. However, when it comes to suffering the consequences of climate change, it is always the poor people that pay the bill. Due to their limited resources in all social aspects, unfortunately, they are most likely to be the first group to truly witness the “doomsday” of climate change, and the group that is dramatically impacted. I felt ashamed in the sense that we, as privileged students in the United States, are not taking enough actions to mitigate the environmental problems but instead leaving those potentially detrimental outcomes to our counterparts, our peers in the poor regions to suffer. Furthermore, not only this generation, but also their children’s generation, their grandchildren’s generation, and so on, until our planet reaches its last day. 
<br><br>
This tied back to the concept of “climate justice” that we discussed in class. The global population as a whole is NOT the root of environmental problems. In fact, it is an underlying racism that is factually misguided and morally incorrect. The social inequity leads to climate injustice, which basically requires impoverished people to pay the price for those who actually caused the problem. Additionally, the older generation’s failure of taking action as well becomes another injustice; in this case, injustice for future generations.  Professor Hiltner’s apology to future generations serves as an excellent example of taking the first step to take action by acknowledging the truthful root of problem. We, as youths living in the 21st century, must recognize that it is time now for people to reduce their carbon-rich footprints, in order to collectively construct a hopeful future for younger generations.
</p><hr>

<p>
"The climate crisis as a generational issue" brought up many good points. Professor Hiltner keeps humor as he acknowledges how he believes that his generation has deeply influenced the climate crisis. I applaud Professor Hiltner in being able to approach this topic in a way that is factual and educational. He stresses importance on our generation for saving the earth, and he has extreme faith in our ability to do so.
</p><hr>

<p>
-       What was interesting to me in this lecture video was the fact that indeed the ‘climate crisis’ did not happen over many hundreds of years and generations like most people think it did... but rather in one lifetime. Using his year of birth as a reference point was extremely moving for me and helped me to understand better how actually fast one generation of people caused the climate crisis. Professor Hiltner also mentioned that in the year he was born, 1959, if the population had taken action to reduce emissions then the climate crisis could have been avoided. But instead of doing this, populations around the world neglected the effects of pollution emissions for far too long and indulged in indirect self-destructive behavior. 
<br><br>
-       On this note of ‘indirect self-destructive behavior,’ I put in the word indirect because indeed although all the effects of climate change effect humans and our civilization, people are reluctant to notice the effects because they do not directly harm them. When people buy gas guzzling Jeeps for example, they most likely have the conscious thought that burning that much petrol into the environment is bad. But what most people don’t realize is that purchasing the gas is bad too. All the energy and resources it takes to frack for gas and all of the greenhouse gasses that are given up into the atmosphere have a comparable effect on humans and the environment to the actual burning of the gas. I think what people of our generation need to realize is that it’s not only about using renewable replacements that aren’t so bad for the environment but to start consuming less to make an actual difference!
</p><hr>

<p>
Hiltners lecture videos mentioned how his generation is to blame for how the world is like now. That was a bit sad but I agree with what he said about future generations having a hard time not abusing the planet. Most of us don’t know what renewable energy is like because we don’t do that here. The U.S. is very dependent on the fossil fuel industry and literally most products are associated with it so it's unavoidable to not contribute to fossil fuel use. 
<br><br>
What really caught my attention was also the point that the world's poorest countries contribute to only 5% of the pollution yet they are the ones who suffer the most. Those countries are the ones who are changing their ways of living to try and save the planet yet they wouldn't make much of a difference because the wealthy countries are still polluting 12x more. These rich countries will not even recognize the problem and I feel like that’s why nothing changed, once these countries recognize what they're doing we can probably save the planet.
<br><br>
The mention of cigarettes was also very important because everyone used to smoke in the 90's and not until the packaging had warning signs did people take the damages of smoking seriously. If we were to do this, have more advertising about the climate crisis, people will be much more informed and can be more conscious about how they are affecting the planet and can possibly help.
<br><br>
We people don’t believe things unless we see them happening and advertising more about the crisis and how it's actually affecting the poor countries will make us compassionate, pathos will always work.
</p><hr>

<p>
I feel that the only hope our generation and those to come have in order to survive and live comfortable on this planet we call home is by working with those of professor Hiltner's generation who genuinely believe and care about the issue of climate change. It blows me away to consider the idea (the fact, actually) that one generation had the ability to produce over 100 parts per million of carbon and send it into the atmosphere, thus destroying our ozone layer and planet within a short 60 years. If climate change had a quicker impact on human life,  as Hiltner stated he wish it had, then we would have a much more stable grip on the crisis, if there even was one. But still, the fact that we are just recently beginning to see consequences at an insane rate means we need to act and not delay our actions in order to save this earth for our future children and grandchildren. The cigarette analogy perfectly describes this dilemma we are in, and if we don't find a way to reverse it, who knows what could happen to the human race as we know it.
</p><hr>

<p>
Although Ken takes a disheartening approach in his explanation in regards to the climate crisis, it is nothing but necessary. The doomsday that is encroaching on the world needs the distressed tone to wake people up and draw attention to the problem at hand.
<br><br>
What I enjoyed about the video is that the simple question, “Why did no one do anything?” is finally answered, a question that I too have wondered about in the past. While it may come across as a simple question, there’s a simple reason for humans’ blind actions. No one cares. The cigarette analogy is a perfect example of this phenomenon. Until people start to feel the effects in their daily lives no one is truly going to tackle the growing population. Things like political agendas are the main reason for our generational split on the climate crisis. Unfortunately, however, by the time we are able to hold positions of power to enact on the problem, it could be too late. Specifically, as Ken mentioned, only 5% of the population makes up for a quarter of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions. Ironically enough, the United States won’t feel the same effects as the poorer nations struggle to combat things like rising tides and extreme weather. People who had minimal contributions to greenhouse gas emissions are going to be forced to migrate. 
<br><br>
Despite these atrocious statistics and saddening information presented in the video, the video itself is a great method to take in order to help combat this unsustainable path of greenhouse gas emissions. Through education, more and more people will be able to see the negative effects associated with many of our daily actions and, hopefully, become more cognizant of what they are doing.
</p><hr>

<p>
Ken’s video “How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime” quantified how much a single generation has greatly contributed to the climate crisis, leaving behind many issues that the upcoming generations will have to find solutions for. Ken describes the climate crisis using an analogy using cigarette smoking and its effects on the smoker’s future generations, but not the smokers themselves. Ken’s analogy hit the nail on the head when it comes to explaining how climate change has become a problem for future generations, even though they weren’t the ones who contributed to the problem. The older generations continued to make the same mistakes over and over again because the response was so delayed, but now that the response is rapidly presenting itself, it has now become the future generations’ burden. 
<br><br>
One can’t entirely blame the older generation of the developed world because the effects were so delayed, but this generation continues to live the same way they always had, which contributed to ¾ of the CO2 in the atmosphere. It doesn’t help that most of the elected officials come from this generation and have a hard time empathizing with the newer generations when it comes to acting fast against climate change. Ken brings up the fact that this job shouldn’t only be for the younger generations, but from those from his own should also help this planet steer away from its potential doom.
</p><hr>

<p>
In Ken’s lecture video he does a really good job of putting the current situation in perspective. He uses smoking cigarettes as an example of what is happening with all the factories. He says that if one in every 8 people smoke it will affect every generation. This is exactly what is happening with climate change but with fossil fuels. This was a great example because it made me realize the effects fossil fuels have on us and how it is affecting the next generation. Many of the younger generation are protesting as they should be because they have been handed such a damaged planet, which may be uninhabitable soon if we dont change. I think it is a good thing for the younger generation to protest because they are all on board with trying to change the planet. The more people that want to make a change the more likely it will happen. When Ken mentioned that the US contributed to a quarter of CO2 emmission I was shocked. The US is 4 % of the population and we are emitting so much CO2. The United States has been so selfish because we are living in a manufactured based society, while the poorer countries will feel the worst consequences when they were emitting the least CO2. This lecture video made me realize how much of an impact every human has on the Climate change crisis and how starting with one person we can start to change for the better.
</p><hr>

<p>
The first video shows how the current generation is fighting for climate change and to fix the mistakes that the previous generation made.  Even though we do not have as much power as the older generation, in terms of politics and corporations, we are still taking steps in the right direction.
<br><br>
The analogy in the second video puts things in perspective.  By comparing a scenario where someone who smokes harms subsequent generations of people after them to our use of fossil fuels, it shows that we will cause our descendants to suffer if we don’t work to prevent climate change.  It shocked me to learn that CO2 in the atmosphere, which had remained around 280 PPM for hundreds of thousands of years, had risen to 415 PPM relatively recently.  This shows how using fossil fuels is directly affecting the earth.  We have to start using clean energy, or else we and our descendants will all suffer.
</p><hr>

<p>
In this first mini-lecture video, I see a lot of things, topics, and emotions, but the most prevailing one and the most touching one is the faith that our professor has in saving the world. Upon this point, I see that there is no way for me to not act like our professor Ken does who puts our planet into consideration and starts to make changes even if they are so radical. Ken's analogy of smoking to the climate crisis is inspiring and thrilling yet sad. I see almost precisely how the climate crisis works in the way of smoking, but the climate crisis is just mush more prevailing and dangerous than the little smoking issue. From this standpoint, I understand that the climate crisis is a built-up problem that the foundation is set up by mostly the rich people in the developed world. And Ken told me that the rich people, from generations ago, started to contaminate the planet with a dramatic pace that they never thought about the consequences to future generations. This is just like the smoking issue, which it does not take everyone on the planet to act to negatively affect other people's life, even the future generation's life. It was so hard to believe that we are on a planet that is crashing to uninhabitable and no one speaks for it or even thinks about it. As Ken does, I am going to join him by taking this course and I'd love to see the proposals he has. There is still hope and this is our future.

  I could totally see the point you made based on the very first mini-lecture. Before watching this video, although I am a person who believes that the climate crisis is happening because of anthropogenic human actions, I never thought that the damage that people are bringing to our planet is actually way bigger than they thought. Ken's lecture definitely takes me back to the cruel reality and really gets me to think more profoundly than before. Besides the interesting analogy of smoking by our professor, the data he provides is also noticeable to me since I could obtain a more comprehensive understanding of our current climate change in the aspect of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. For instance, Ken brings up the fact that the amount of carbon dioxide had increased from 280 ppm to 315 ppm by 1959, which was the year that Ken was born, but more seriously, this number ballooned to 415 ppm recently. Also, later in the lecture, Ken puts up a graph that basically states that the CO2 amount could explode in a more drastic way if the trend keeps going. Based on these, taking his life as an example, Ken absolutely awakens me to the topic “how the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” and I think there’s no better way other than data evidence to consolidate one’s point. 
  <br><br>
       Moreover, I’m so touched because of how faithful Ken was to save our planet and his resonant apology. Admittedly, our ancestors left us a messy legacy and an urgent situation, but we, as a whole, keep making it worse. We must be the ones to make a change for ourselves and our planet. That’s why I joined Ken’s course and follow his path to explore the solution of saving our environment. I suggest that we all should raise our awareness of the time delay, which was the major cause of the climate crisis, and before we actually take into actions that are contributing to our climate crisis, not only should we consider our children and descendants as the potential victim of our actions, but also care about the living environment of hundreds and thousands of natural species all over the world.

<p>
In the “The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue” lecture and “How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime,” Mr.Ken talks about how people in the past ruined the environment by burning fossil fuels and emitting CO2 into the atmosphere. Mankind's history shows that development must not be achieved by wasting resources and destroying the environment. Certainly many argue that while the past may have improved by technologies and education, surely it doesn’t matter for the future, because we are still destroying the environment. If resources are not used with appropriate care, or worse, taken for granted, with the nation's pace of development and consumption, humans can also damage the environment, faster than it knows. I think the professor summarizes and emphasizes the climate crisis in detail and logic. All in all, this video and lecture are easy to understand and convincing.
</p><hr>

<p>
I was shocked after watching “How climate crisis brought about a single lifetime.” It really impacted me when Ken mentioned how “during a lifetime people enjoy and thousands suffer” Thus there are people that are not to blame at all and have to pay for the damage that the others have caused. What also shocked me was when he said that a quarter of the CO2 placed on the atmosphere was caused by our country the US. It is really sad to think that past generations have led the problem to worsen and that even now most still refuse to do something and don’t educate much of the generations of today to do something either. I can’t envision how my children or grandchildren will live in the future. It depresses me to think that that they will live in danger that I will not be there to protect them.
<br><br> 
I feel like even though most teenagers are doing small movements to make a difference. It is still not enough. People are not ready to give up the great life they live today and as long as that is, the crisis will continue. To make a change it is important to continue to educate people until this issue sticks in their brain completely.

I had a very similar reaction to the information about how much the US contributes to climate change. To think that a country with so much power and eloquence in many ways has neglected to care about this impending issue is sickening. It is so sad to think that the people who did the least damage will truly be hit the hardest with the consequences, and the people who did the most damage will continue to live unknowing of the detrimental effects that they were also a part of. While watching this video I too thought about the world that my grandchildren will live in because based on the information about climate change I have learned about in these two videos and this in this class in general, the world will not be the same place that it is today.
<br><br>
Teenagers and activists today seem to be getting more momentum, but I completely agree it is not enough. People don't see any immediate negative outcomes, so they don't care. Some people don't have the ability or resources to care as they are struggling to get by in the world, but we live in the US and we DO have the ability and resources to care and make a stand. I hope that this movement is able to grow and continue to spread globally so we can make the first steps towards saving the world before it is too late.
<br><br><hr><br>
I completely agree that even our generation, not the previous ones, may fail to take action and initiative against the pressing issue that our world faces today. Although I do believe that education outlets - such as this class - allows for people to imprint the idea of climate change within their minds, I truly believe that it is the lack of a first step and the control of political and economic power that continues to prevent and divert our resources and willpower to help stop climate change once and for all. For example, our current administration has taken a step back on the issue of climate change by pulling out of the Paris Agreement. Politicians, news outlets, and influencers have stated that they believe that climate change is a hoax created by the left-wing of politicians. And today, developed nations still live a lavish life while developed countries will continue to suffer. Professor Hiltner creates this point by stating that the underdeveloped nations may become what is known as this outside world in which suffering exists for generations to come, while the resources that developed nations hold can offset and reduce the impact that climate change has on their nations. Simply put: policies imply that we do not care about the future and that we do not care about others. It is as clear-cut as that. And, if in our lifetime, our generation cannot grasp that idea, then we will lose this battle of climate change.

In the lecture, Ken discusses how the previous generation put foundation for current environmental issue, the climate changes, that the world faces. And he points out that his generation are actually contribute the most to the climate change and they didn’t take actions which caused pressure no the next generation. I agree with the Ken’s say of the growing interest of the climate crisis in teenagers today. And I also agree with his point that the generation before us  ignore the signs of climate change, leaving us more pressure on dealing with severe climate problem and in the position of having to quickly find a solution.
<br><br>
In the second lecture, Ken’s talk about current situation of climate change. And i was very surprised that poor country people contribute only about 5% to the climate change. In contrary, developed countries, such as the America, take up almost 1/4 responsibility.
</p><hr>

<p>
Before signing up for this class and watching Ken’s youtube videos I never realized how much of the CO2 that has been emitted into the atmosphere was caused by the US alone. With these numbers drastically increasing as time passes, you would think that more people would begin to take action towards helping our planet. Celebrities always tend to talk about climate change and disasters occurring all over the world on their social media platforms. Many times, they don’t take action or put their fame to use. With their advocacy and/or financial contributions, many of the issues found around the world could be eradicated, nonetheless preventable in the future. 
<br><br>
Just like Ken stated, my generation has learned from their past generation the wrong habits they commit, unconsciously, because of what they were initially taught. I find it sad that instead of cutting back on the emission of fossil fuels into the atmosphere and potentially slowing down the climate crisis process, the last generation chose to ignore the consequences that arose from their actions. While these issues aren’t irreversible, my generation and the next has the potential to inform others on how the human race can work towards a better planet. With the PPM being the highest it has ever been, we have to make some changes before it really is too late.

 I too was unaware of how much of a percentage first wold-countries like Europe and the U.S. contributed to the emotion of CO2. It was definitely upsetting to learn about how much “poor” countries who already lack many resources are the ones paying most for the actions of countries who have the power to do better. In regard to your comment about celebrities using their platform to do better for our environment, I agree. Not only do a lot of these celebrities hold an influence to push people towards a more sustainable way of living, I can only assume they are often producing more CO2 than the average person as their lifestyle is more “luxurious”, meaning they are more likely to use more resources as they are more available to them. However, I tend not to think about groups of people when it comes to this issue as there are alternatives to the way each and every one of us consumes. This is also why I agree with the point you make of our generation pushing towards a more efficient way of gaining and consuming resources and teaching future generations about this as well. A huge shift in culture and consumption must be changed and while it’s tough to think about since we “benefit” from a lot of the negative impacts our planet has to deal with, we have to be responsible about our own actions before calling others out on theirs.
<br><br>
Another unfortunate truth as Ken mentioned is that those whom contributed most to the issue are the ones likely to see less of its impact. I find that when I dwell on this perspective rather than thinking about the many ways I can be a change I shift my focus on why certain people are to “blame”. I prefer to think about prior generation's mistakes as opportunities for us to learn rather than to briefly think about and ignore. In my opinion, the conversation should always be about what we can do to help and not so much about what others should have done better.
<br><br><hr><br>
I also find it astonishing that there is this much lack of action happening toward the climate crisis. Like the professor said most of the carbon dioxide contributing to climate change was put there within his lifetime of sixty years. This seems to be why we are so slow in acting against it and turning toward cleaner alternatives. The consequences won't be fully felt until later since we are adding greenhouse gases at an unprecedented rate so it's hard to understand. However, this is why I felt the cigarette analogy was so important to the video. It allows for explaining the situation in more common terms and I thought it was a great way to highlight the injustice of the issue.

To begin, I appriciate the hopeful tone Ken uses in prefacing this video because I do think this is an attitude we must maintain while trying to face this massive and extensive issue. We must have hope in humanity while also realizing how dire circumstances are. It’s astounding the fact that indulgence has led us to the point in such a relatively short span of time.. and it really shows how dominant the flawed mentality of instant gratification is among our society. All life is being impacted, because of humankind- and it’s about time we start to realize how selfish and unsustainable our lifestyles are. Though it breaks my heart to say, it’s like watching a train wreck. I’m completely in awe because when I reflect on this information and look back on my own experiences I realize that we are really now starting to see effects of this. As of recent ive noticed there seems to be way more catastrophic events- specifically fires, and I’m certain it’s not just because I’m older and more aware. This, is happening now. I’m disheartened because I feel our country needs to take far more accountability and action. Our emissions are horrifying, and that’s just factual and non disputable. I do find it the developed world to set an example because the developed world sets the model for the rest of the world, and if we can make change anyone can. It’s dire that we redirect the idea of the American dream, reject materialism and make large changes before other countries make the same mistakes we did. 
<br><br>
I appreciate the boomers that realize this is an issue our generation now faces largely because of them and the direction our countries gone in regarding policy on climate change. I hope to see others challenge the idea that ignorance is bliss in regards to global warming and realize that to make change we must begin accepting the certain truth that we are in a state of alarm.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching the lecture videos, I wondered what people disregarding climate change are blinded by. Videos like the one above present unarguably real facts: like how we’ve tripled the rate of CO2 going into atmosphere, how the U.S. attributed to a horrifying amount of the harmful existing greenhouse gases, and how almost half of the population nearly didn’t  even contribute to the horrifying extent of climate change. Maybe it was guilt? Maybe it isn’t that people aren’t informed, but their burden of guilt weighs too heavy on their shoulders to get up and move toward solutions. Maybe it’s greed? It could be the U.S.’s cling to self-prosperity. 
<br><br>
I think it’s all of those things. I truly believe, though, that a principle cause in the some of society’s defensiveness against climate change is explained when Ken explains people’s ideals about this issue as a “thought experiment.” Most people are at least aware of this issue and know it’s negatively affecting us now and will later. Many see an Instagram post about it, think of climate change’s effects, then goes on Twitter. It’s something that lives in our minds but not in our lives. I’m guilty of this too: I admit, at this point, I have not done enough. We cannot just be worried, and we especially can’t be oblivious. Climate change cannot just exist in our thoughts, but be actively prevented by how we live our lives; starting now.
</p><hr>

<p>
I have to say I’m pretty appalled by how extraordinary the difference in fossil fuel emissions is from the U.S., Europe, and Russia is compared to the poorest 3 billion people on the planet. It’s an injustice to the highest extent that those who contribute the least damage to the Earth are those who will suffer the most in the face of the climate crisis. It goes to show just how much our culture and society are driven by the need to consume fossil fuels. 
<br><br>
I also am grateful that Ken makes a point to apologize for the older generations that were the main cause of the planet’s rapid climate change. I don’t think we see people openly and sincerely apologize for leaving climate change and its consequences on my generation nearly enough. I like that the first video, “The climate crisis as a generational issue” highlighted this resentment and frustration in the light of the many strikes and movements that this younger generation has started in response to the effects of climate change. Ken also does a great job of explaining the effects of climate change on our world in concise and easy-to-understand fashion in “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, which helps the average, or less-informed viewer, understand what’s happening to our planet.
</p><hr>

<p>
I often think how long it would take for us to actually resolve this issue. The climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime, yes, but how many lifetimes until we actually begin to reduce emissions? Not just America but the entire world. In lecture you mentioned that US emissions went up 3%. There is a lot of awareness, and protests going on regarding the climate crisis yet, our emissions continue to rise. When will we begin to see change? Many of us make changes in our own lives. Going vegan, buying bulk, making our own products,  living zero waste and we have yet to see the fruits of our labor. There is so much uncertainty regarding the climate crisis and its solution. The IPCC reports recommendation to maintain a cap on the global temperature rise requires technologies that haven't even been invented yet. Despite this, many continue as vegans, children in schools walk out into protests, some compost, others bike, all to make up for the mistakes of one generation. It's very frustrating and disheartening to know that I have to sacrifice my commodities because of the greed of the generation before me.

<p>
I find the first video/lecture regarding the state of the Earth given to our generation of people very inspiring in a way for my age group of people to band together and make a change. Regardless of the baffling and appalling idea of our parent's generation to not consider such atrocities, we need to make a difference now. It is a disturbing idea and almost sad feeling thinking the prior generations had no thought of the Earth they were living on. 
<br><br>
In the second video I find the comparison to smoking everyday and giving all repercussions upon my children. This idea made me nearly sick to think that a thought like such would even be in consideration. I understand and do somewhat believe carbon fuels and such did develop our human society in a monumental way. Though this is true, I do feel we should have been thoughtful of this before. Even that being said we also can look at smoking for example, and see that the older generations and the people before us didn’t know the consequences. This very well was what I think the issue was in the past and that is why they took such measures in production and the burning of fossil fuels.
</p><hr>

<p>
In the lectures “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” and “The climate crisis as a generational issue” we are able to see that we humans are at main fault for global warming. We need to take action and find solutions to stop our world from continuing to become a fossil fuel addict. It’s sad to hear that the United States, Europe, and Russia are weighing with 66.6% of the CO2 admitted into the atmosphere. We are responsible for this, and our generation isn’t well informed nor do they know the damages they will produce to the future. We are currently living without the effects, but we are destroying the home of the next generations. It was also crazy to hear that the levels of CO2 had risen 3 times more than other centuries with 100 ppm in a 60 year period. It’s sad to think of what earth will become if we continue to have high levels of CO2.

<p>
This video brings a crucial concept to the forefront of explaining climate skepticism and inaction - time delay. The delayed effects of fossil fuel burning and carbon pollution have not fit the dominant framework of humans' perceptions of cause and effect. This time delay created a large degree of uncertainty concerning the correlation between carbon and climate change which allowed for a period of denial and negligence. Climate scientists have been working incessantly for the past several decades trying to convince the world that climate change is happening, that it is a result of anthropogenic carbon input, and that it will have dire consequences for the world. Although the scientific consensus has confirmed these claims for decades, and have continually found new evidences to prove them, the science has been systematically challenged and undermined by lobbying efforts and political pressures with deep pockets and strong incentives.
<br><br>
I love that Hiltner uses the analogy of cigarette smoking in trying to portray the reality of carbon pollution and climate change. Not only is it accurate, it is especially significant because of how connected the tobacco industry is to climate denial and inaction. Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway discuss this connection in their book Merchants of Doubt. They talk about how the same group of scientists, corporations, institutions, and lobbyists that denied the harmful health impacts of cigarette smoking spearheaded the efforts to challenge climate science. In so many ways, cigarette smoking is analogous to burning fossil fuels. As we choke our own lungs with tobacco smoke, we choke the lungs of the earth with carbon.
<br><br>
Towards the end of the video, we start to touch on the issue of climate justice, an important facet of environmental injustice, which in my opinion is one of the most critical societal issues of the modern era. Many people, environmentalists and all, focus too much on the ecological impacts of climate change and environmental degradation and only consider technological innovations to remediate these impacts. Although important, this focus often fails to consider the disproportionate effects that have been and will continue to be felt by marginalized groups, which have historically hardly contributed to the problem in the first place. Solving the climate crisis and saving the natural environment must account for this historical context. We cannot create a sustainable world without creating an equitable one.

Ken’s lecture clips were very sincere and honest about the development of the climate crisis and about those who have been responsible for it. It’s mind blowing how three fourths of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been added since 1959. I think that fact can really go to show how our current climate crisis is anthropogenic in nature, and not just a gradual changing of the planet. The generational aspect of the climate crisis makes sense, and Ken’s explanation gave an easy understanding with the cigarette metaphor. It’s easy to engage in destructive behavior if it’s not impacting you directly in the here and now, but instead may affect others down the line. That’s what has happened with greenhouse gas emissions and other environmentally detrimental behaviors. The effects were not noticed at first, but now, generations later, we are experiencing them firsthand. I was also surprised to learn that most of the planet (in terms of population) is not really responsible for the climate crisis, as the underdeveloped countries are not contributing nearly as much as the developed world to the burning of fossil fuels. It makes me sad to know that the poorer countries will suffer more from the climate crisis, while they did not contribute as much to the problem. Looking towards the future, I do have a lot of hope for my generation and our willingness to change our behaviors to be more environmentally conscious, especially with all the knowledge we now have available to us.

<p>
This video has opened my eyes to the abhorrent environmental injustice in the world today. The fact that 2/3 of the CO2 emitted to the atmosphere was caused by Europe, Russia, and the United States, which only account for 1/8 of the world's population is shocking. It is unfair that these countries that are overwhelmingly contributing to the climate crisis are going to be the countries that are most well off in the future as the planet worsens. These countries caused the majority of the CO2 emissions, yet, because of their wealth, they can be less affected in the future by the devastation climate change causes, while people in poorer countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan African countries, will suffer more from something they did not heavily contribute to. The environmental injustice is inherently racist, and a major issue that needs to be addressed. These lecture videos are very insightful and really expose the many problems this world faces involving climate injustice. 
<br><br>
It is unbelievable that 3/4 of CO2 emitted in human history has been since 1959... Why is it that older generations are rapidly destroying the planet, yet those same people refuse to believe in climate change, or refuse to help correct the problem they started? Again, the climate injustice comes into play. My generation is actively partaking in climate strikes, participating in the Sunrise Movement, volunteering and voting for progressive politicians who promise to bring forth a Green New Deal, etc. My generation is doing some of the most work to address and correct the climate crisis, yet it is my generation and subsequent, future generations who will be hit hardest by the climate crisis, yet we did not contribute to it as much as the Baby Boomer generation has.

<p>
"The climate crisis as a generational issue", demonstrated that there are many in our generation beginning to take action. The video served as an introduction to the ongoing destruction of our planet, who it is to blame, and " how the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime". 
Many people are contributing to this self-destructing behavior of releasing fossil fuels into our atmosphere and it is quite alarming. But as Ken mentioned, we contribute to the suffering of the life on the planet and generations ahead of us because we aren't pushed to act. It is quite astonishing that we Americans, that makeup 4% of the population, have contributed 1/4th of the co2 in the atmosphere and that " half of the planet's people have nothing to do with the climate crisis". The casual abuse of our planet is becoming more troubling as  the workers of the fossil fuel economy & politicians are the ones who we expect to find a way and or contribute to resolve the issue; they are the ones who hold the power. What I found most interesting  was the injustice being brought upon those who have little contribution to the crisis. It is heartbreaking that those who live in the less developed part of the world will suffer because of the mistakes of others.

<p>
It boggles my mind how just one single lifetime can have such a devastating effect on our planet. The previous generation has been entirely irresponsible and selfish, leaving us with this crisis to deal with. And still this generation continues to live and refuses to let go of the power and wealth they have gained at the expense of the planet. It disgusts me as it should all of us, but unfortunately it doesn't. The fossil fuel industry has a tight grip on this world, on its countries, on its people. I for one don’t want to sit by and watch this crisis unfold, I want to fight the power and greed of this world, and help create a new one. As Prof. Hiltner states, this will be our generation's biggest challenge, and hopefully we are able to learn from the mistakes of the last generation. 
<br><br>
I found it interesting that well before the neanderthals, CO2 held itself at 280 ppm, and by 1959, it had risen to 315 ppm. The time gap, at least speaking in relatively human time, is somewhat large. However, when we learn that from 1959 to 2019, the atmosphere holds CO2 at 415 ppm, an 100ppm increase. Meaning that in a single lifetime , we have pumped out more than a quarter of the CO2 in the atmosphere. It’s quite ridiculous if you stop and think about it.
</p><hr>

<p>
The fact that the repercussions of global warming are already being seen and have resulted from the lifestyles of one generation is shocking. Even in my daily life, whether it be buying a coffee in a single-use plastic cup or wearing clothes that have been a result of my partaking in fast fashion, I can see just how many times I could be more sustainable. I have improved my sustainability much more in the past years, but always ask myself, “Am I doing enough.” The sad part is most of the daily lifestyle choices that are unsustainable make life so much easier and that’s where I believe most of the population falls short in protecting our earth. 
<br><br>
Ken’s apology is very heartfelt and significant because there are so many members of the past generation that either do not acknowledge or do not admit to the damage they have caused to the climate. The scariest part about climate change is the fact that a portion of the population denies its existence. Without the effort of the entire population, or at least the majority, the repercussions and consequences of the detrimental habits of the last generation will continue to wreak havoc on our climate.
</p><hr>

<p>
It is devastating that substantial scientific evidence of the negative consequences of global warming has existed for nearly half a century, yet the momentum of the environmental movement has only picked up within the past few decades. However, the ignorance towards the global warming is still ingrained within our country and other industrialized nations. Although the effects of climate change may not be significantly evident within the United States, the consequences faced by other nations is real and incredibly devastating. It is shameful that even with the evidence of climate change, there are still government officials and industry leaders that deny such proof in order to maintain economic profits and power. Additionally, our reliance on fossil fuels within our everyday lives adds to the complexity of the situation. While changes can be made within our own lives, such as changes to our diets and limiting the amount of energy consumption, it is necessary for our leaders to take action. Commitments to sustainable actions on a large scale are needed to see immediate change. Unfortunately, it seems as though changes among large industry powers will only happen once they are threatened by economic losses and demands by consumers. Although the future may appear to be bleak, educating ourselves about the consequences of climate change is one of the first steps towards creating a sustainable future. I am looking forward to learning more about what my generation can do to create a sustainable and healthy planet.

<p>
Professor Hiltner mentions in his lecture videos how most of the CO2 in the atmosphere was caused by one generation in less than a lifetime. I find it irresponsible of the United States and other developed countries for their negligence in regulating their CO2 footprint on the Earth especially since they constituted ⅔ of the emitted CO2. The poorest 3 billion people are only responsible for 5%, yet they will feel the consequences of our CO2 footprint the greatest. I believe that the analogy with cigarettes is a great example to describe how the climate crisis will affect future generations. When people finally realized the health problems associated with smoking cigarettes, it was already too late for those who were already affected. If we do not act soon, the same will happen with our Earth. People will not act until they see the consequences of their CO2 footprint. As Professor Hiltner explained, the time delay is the most alarming. Because of the time delay, people will not see the effects of our CO2 footprint until they actually occur, and by that time the consequences will be catastrophic. I also agree that the delayed impact of dumping CO2 into our atmosphere caused a generational split. Our generation will be left with the responsibility of saving our Earth.
</p><hr>

<p>
Professor Hiltner's lecture adds to my perspective of questioning exactly what I can do to help prevent this climate crisis considering that the actions of my predecessors have dug the hole that we now sit in. For a country that prides itself in always being at the forefront of advancements its extremely ironic that we are also, for the most part, one of the major investors on our road to extinction. What frustrates me the most about the mistake of the previous generation is the fact that many still continue to deny us our future. Instead of investing in the future of their family they invest in their now and ultimately leave us with the broken. As seen in the lecture and the movie Before the Flood, children and many governments are forced to live and provide tough lives that many times don't even suffice for basic necessities. How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime and the climate crisis as a generational issue display how the ignorance of a whole generation has potentially brought about irreversible consequences that could lead to the death of many future generations to come. Overall, these two lectures emphasize that although the past generation has made a mistake we shouldn't lose hope and continue to fight for our survival and the betterment of the human race.
</p><hr>

<p>
In the first lecture, he explains how the youth is rebelling b/c for decades we have been saying we need to change and how older generations basically put the responsibility upon us who are going to be living through this. This means that we must do all that we can in order to find a solution. Even though many (not all) in the older generation may not believe this is an issue we can still make a difference since it is going to be our children experiencing these downfalls and our lives that must go through the horrible consequences of climate change, therefore, our responsibility. 
<br><br>
In the second lecture, I found the comparison of cigarette smoking very interesting and a good way to explain the concept of climate change. As this may not hurt the older generations it will directly hurt their children and grandchildren. Moreover, the lecture states the co2 levels rose from 280 ppm to 415 ppm, which is plain out ridiculous! In my eyes, this is quite scary and is just increasing dramatically as the years go on. This should be a marker for EVERYONE to take action because this clearly demonstrates that it is not normal as the co2 levels are drastically rising exponentially. 3/4 of the greenhouse gas causing the climate crisis was produced in just one lifetime! This should be extremely alarming and puts a very good perspective to see how fast this is all happening. The United States is greatly responsible for contributing C02 into the atmosphere and I think there needs to be more statements of this so everybody in the U.S. knows this!
</p><hr>

<p>
The lecture "The climate crisis as a generational issue" as well as this video was really interesting as they brought the way I see the climate crisis into a new standing. To recognize that the majority of the pollution and contamination that caused climate change that been put into the air in one lifetime is certainly shocking. However, learning that the reason for and influence of the climate crisis aren’t as urgent as people would anticipate is both interesting and anxious, as it makes me wonder what is yet to come. The video starts with how there are members of the younger generation who have begun to protest. The younger generation is outraged about the climate change problem that did not just occur in this generation but the generation before and it has continued to worsen over time. Since this problem has been ignored during the past few generations, many people right now have chosen to ignore it too. 
<br><br>
However, climate change count as s snowballing effect. It is not something that just happened but had been raising up through the past generations. The disasters that we’ve seen now days are just the beginning, things are going to be much scarier, and more varieties are going to suffer. One helpful point is that if efforts and attention are taken rapidly, we could prevent the circumstances from growing more critical.
</p><hr>

<p>
Before watching this video, the thought of how our climate crisis was caused in a single lifetime never crossed my mind. Initially, I thought that CO2 emissions have been on the rise since the Industrial Revolution. Although, for decades, there has always been a strong emphasis on how we should change the way we inhabit out planet, CO2 emissions have increased exponentially. Considering how CO2 is the most significant greenhouse gas, the fact that within the past 60 years it has risen from 200 ppm to 415 ppm is astounding. However, 3/4 of the CO2 in the atmosphere has been emitted in a single lifetime. The people whom are responsible for this catastrophe are still alive and are not doing enough to address these issues. The U.S., Europe, China and Russia are the main contributors. It’s disappointing that the most privileged countries in the world, who have the most power to change the way in which our world is heading, are not doing enough to change the way in which these issues affect the entire world. We have so much access to technologies that can make a difference, yet nothing is being done. It won’t be us who faces these consequences severely, it will be in developing countries - those in which have to power to make a difference. 
<br><br>
The future as we know it, will not be in our favor. What I find hard to believe is that generations whom have vowed to change their ways have yet to do anything to change the way in which they contribute to our environmental crisis. Why is it that we, the younger generations, have to cause a rebellion in order to address issues that have been so prevalent within our society?

  (in response to the final question)
Although it may not be fair, it makes complete sense to me why the younger generations are the ones taking action, even though perhaps the older generations caused this crisis and are now well aware of that. This is because we, the younger generation, are the ones who face the repercussions more than older generations. The carbon footprints of one generation are directly harming the generations that come after, not their own. It is easy to blame people for not owning up to their actions, but because the impacts are not shown until years later, it makes sense why people were in denial years ago, because there was less physical “proof” and more of a theorized threat for the future. People who “do not believe in climate change” may just not understand it because they are not the ones being directly affected. I am sure that people who live in coastal regions with flooding everyday or those facing the Australian wildfires today understand climate change much more than others who just hear about it. The older generations did not live through the consequences that the younger generations see in everyday life growing up now. The younger generations today are educated on the issue, therefore are obligated to act upon it, even if it was caused more by the generation before us, in just one very harmful lifetime.
<br><br>
So although I feel it makes sense why the younger generations would be more passionate about the issue than the older ones, it is a shame that we are not receiving as much support from them and we must go about it in a way that does seem like a rebellion. Lack of knowledge on the subject or proof that it exists are no longer valid excuses for ignoring the crisis of climate change like they once possibly were. It seems like it may just be up to the younger generations to persevere and protect the planet for future generations to come, even though the ones before us did not do the same.

Both of these lecture snippets by Professor Hiltner introduce very eye-opening and shocking facts. I find it absolutely outrageous to hear that the majority of pollution, greenhouse gas, fossil fuel and contamination all happened within one lifetime. I loved how the climate crisis was explained on a deeper and more engaging level while using Professor Hiltner’s birth year and the comparison to cigarettes. The cigarette analogy was extremely clever because it helped individuals understand that how we let this happen and what actions are directly affecting the climate. It is repulsive to learn that us Americans, which make up 4% of the population have contributed around 1/4th of the carbon emission in the atmosphere and that 1/2 of the individuals in other 3 world countries have nothing to do with the severity of the climate crises. This is sickening because the other half of the planet which will be completely affected by our disastrous actions are innocent and have no access to air conditioners, electricity, heat, gas or cars to help them try to survive these catastrophes. It is also really saddening to think that our actions today will ultimately affect our children and grandchildren. We have set up a truly disastrous world for them.

<p>
The lectures on “The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue” and “How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime” discussed how the increasing levels of CO2 and methane in our atmosphere are largely due to one generation of “fossil fuel addiction” and how combating and mitigating climate change will largely fall on the generation becoming adults today. 
<br><br>
The part of the lecture that most struck me was the fact that those who have least contributed to CO2 in the atmosphere will have to bear the brunt of the effects of climate change. It seems like there ought to be some sort of accountability for countries, like the U.S., who are responsible for the largest portion of CO2 in our atmosphere. While I understand that it would be difficult to hold countries responsible for their past behavior, I do hope that a carbon tax, as described in “Before the Flood”, is implemented as there is little incentive for big businesses to cut down on their carbon footprint when its use has been so instrumental in the accumulation of wealth. I see no other way of effectively discouraging business from contributing to CO2 than to make the use of CO2 economically difficult.

<p>
The lecture "The climate crisis as a generational issue" as well as this video was really interesting as they brought the way I see the climate crisis into a new standing. To recognize that the majority of the pollution and contamination that caused climate change that been put into the air in one lifetime is certainly shocking. However, learning that the reason for and influence of the climate crisis aren’t as urgent as people would anticipate is both interesting and anxious, as it makes me wonder what is yet to come. The video starts with how there are members of the younger generation who have begun to protest. The younger generation is outraged about the climate change problem that did not just occur in this generation but the generation before and it has continued to worsen over time. Since this problem has been ignored during the past few generations, many people right now have chosen to ignore it too. 
<br><br>
However, climate change count as s snowballing effect. It is not something that just happened but had been raising up through the past generations. The disasters that we’ve seen now days are just the beginning, things are going to be much scarier, and more varieties are going to suffer. One helpful point is that if efforts and attention are taken rapidly, we could prevent the circumstances from growing more critical.

</p><hr>

<p>
In Hiltner’s lecture videos, he introduces an important issue about who is to blame for the climate crisis. It is evident that as younger generations, like my own, are becoming more aware of climate change, they are becoming more concerned, upset, and ready to take action for the destruction that the previous generation has left behind. If we look at research, global warming has been an issue for decades and nothing was done during that time. The reason for some generations putting the blame on other generations is because the majority of CO2 was produced in a single lifetime. Hiltner also shows how the wealthiest countries in the world are the ones contributing to CO2 in the atmosphere (66.67%), whereas poorer countries only contribute 5% and they make up about half the population of the world. He also states that ¼ of CO2 came from America. It is so concerning to know that your own country is one of the main reasons that the planet will soon be uninhabitable for all life. I am also terrified that maybe I contributed to some of this destruction myself. But, the use of fossil fuels with greenhouse gases are tearing our planet apart and killing us species by species, and humans are next. We need to start saving ourselves from a sixth mass extinction.
</p><hr>

<p>
One of the main things I’ve heard and think about a lot in regards to climate change is that this generation has to think about whether or not we should have kids because of the climate change conditions they would be raised in. I guess this question is being posed to more than just people my age but it made it makes it feel like climate change is our fault. Why should we ever have to think about that type of question? Why wasn’t this question or moral responsibility ever placed on other generations before us? I’m glad that Ken is acknowledging that climate change was mainly created by the generations before me but it still feels as though the responsibility is all on us. We are the ones that have to stand up to the problem and find solutions, not politicians who just think we are naive kids. I am really interested to see what Ken says he thinks the solution to climate change is. But I wonder if it is still possible, the film made it seem like our last full out effort should have been years ago. That's what it feels like it's coming to, our last minute attempt keeps getting pushed back over and over again. When will we really stand up to the problem.

<p>
"The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue" brings up many good points about the heavily debated fact that Climate  Change was brought on due to a lack of care from past generations. I admire Professors Kens take on the issue. From the start, Ken addresses the fact that the majority of the people that caused the current crisis, are still alive and contributing evermore to it. As the upcoming generation that must deal with this problem, It is comforting to know that there are people from past generations who acknowledge the mistakes made and are standing by to help in what ever way they can.
</p><hr>

<p>
In the lecture of “How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime”, the message about the dramatic changes that have occurred in the past few decades resonated with me. To talk about the climate change in the context of Professor Hiltner’s birth year, 1959, and how it could have been a turning point for the planet was impactful because, as he said, his generation created this catastrophe. What really struck me was the fact that through his cigarette analogy, I realized we collectively will be paying for “the sins of our fathers”. The consequences are easy for many climate change denialists to  deal with because those individuals have not seen and might not see the consequences of their actions. Ironically, the greatest polluters, the developed world, will be slower to see the consequences than those poorer countries who did not create the problem, allowing politicians and industrialists continue to fight against environmental policy.
<br><br>
This brings me to the first lecture video, “the climate crisis as a generational issue” in which Professor Hiltner recognizes the climate change movement by the younger generation. As he said, this younger generation is being handed a planet which is  in severe need of help. Furthermore, this generation is angry that previous generations did not take action. Through the understanding of the cigarette analogy in the second lecture, today’s youth are the sufferers even if they weren’t the original perpetrators of  this crisis. The reason that action wasn’t taken sooner is because people didn’t witness the consequences back then. As explained in the lectures, the impact of oil in contaminating water is highly visible. The impact of greenhouse gases on the earth is not as visible, especially with the ocean absorbing a quarter of emissions. Overall, the inaction of the previous generations needs to be offset immediately by the younger one.

I also felt this, knowing that in one single lifetime the amount of devastation people have contributed is insane. The cigarette analogy also allowed me a different perspective that I think more people should realize when climate change is addressed. People only care about what affects them- a sad but true statement- and I feel as though the analogy encourages people to create a cause to care about rather than discussing about the horrid state of the coral reef. We are paying for "the sins of our fathers" and so will out children and so on. The fact that the people that are the most innocent are taking the majority of our climates devastating reaction and those with immense greed will be the last to experience the changes.
<br><br>
You bring up phenomenal points, our generation is angry- a type of blinding anger that infuriates us because the same can be said in those who contributed most ( our previous generations) will not be here when the devastation hits but we will. We are inheriting the monster of the climate crisis and we will have to be the ones who need to repair the damage done by the major corporations and previous generations. However, I feel as though our generation is still helpless enough in which we are not in full positions of power and our job is to educate others in what is occurring. It is devastating to know that we have a long road ahead of us when it comes to being able to save this planet and by the looks of it we needed to start a long time ago.

We caused this, our ancestors caused this, and we have to be the one's to change that. Ken's lecture on how we brought the climate crisis upon ourselves outlines exactly what was done and what needs to be done to save our planet. I think its funny that the same people who argue that an abortion is unfair because the baby had no choice in the decision, are the ones who argue that climate change is not real and that today's generation is the reason why it exists because of "fake news". Now i know, those two topics are extremely controversial and cannot really be compared because they exist in different realms of morality and thought, but it is interesting to think about how the same judgment can shift when approaching a scientifically proved dilemma. I found the realities of this problem to be extremely unsettling and eye opening, and I strongly believe that Ken is displaying information that is relevant to the issue. People with the most power tend to be the same people who have the least difficulty experiencing what the majority of the world is going through regarding climate change. 
<br><br>
Although the older generation did cause this and we were born into it without much of a choice, that still does not mean that it is their job to fix it as well. We must help with that effort and more importantly we must make sure that effort is sustained for the rest of our lives. Generations after us must also be well informed and taught about how to make sure the global climate crisis does not plunge back into darkness and death, but instead working on new methods to reduce our footprint to maybe even make things better. I believe that education is the number one way to reduce climate change regardless of what resources a person has. If everyone is educated on the issue and the norm around the globe is awareness about climate change, then the questions that hamper the finding and development of ways to implement change will not be presented against anyone. It begins with educating everyone on how they can do little things that really will make a difference even though it may not seem so.

I can really tell from your first paragraph that you feel very passionately about this issue. I feel like there are two main things that are enabling people to still deny climate change as a serious issue. The first one is the lack of education that people have about the overall issue. By this, I mean that many people are unknowledgeable about what climate change is, what causes it, what this means for life on Earth, and which human actions are propelling it. With this lack of knowledge, people have no choice but to be simply ignorant of what's going on in our environment. Even with noticeable changes such as increasing temperatures, prolonged droughts, more intense hurricanes and weather patterns, and more destructive fire seasons, the population that's uneducated about this issue wouldn't know to connect these to climate change. This poses a serious problem because then this same population would feel no urgency to change their current habits to more sustainable ones. So, I agree with your argument that more education on this topic is needed for all current and future generations if any improvement is going to be made.
<br><br>
Another problem I believe our society faces is that we have people in high and powerful places that are outright denying climate change as even an existing issue. This, to me, is completely absurd and almost a waste of power. Despite how much we, as humans, would like to say that we aren't influenced by those we see on TV or read about on social media, the truth is that we can't help but absorb what they say and take it, to an extent, as the truth. I'm mostly referring to political figures when I talk about this issue because they are who is standing in the way of making a real policy change that could enforce sustainability habits, or at the very least punish big corporations for excessive carbon emissions. I truly believe that if any real change is going to be made, the youth movement that's talked about in "The climate crisis as a generational issue" alone isn't going to get us there. We need to have politics on our side.

In both “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, I felt almost provoked as I learned about past generations and even humans now are abusing the earth. When I heard that from 1959-2019 carbon dioxide levels had risen by 100 ppm, I was utterly shocked that our government had allowed this. However, the time delay situation that caused people to not see the consequences directions made a lot of sense in why the government, and virtually everybody had allowed this. The time delay also explains why my generation seems to care so much more about it and take action than older generations. The fact that Greta Thunberg is taking action, as well as seeing the school walk out and protests gives me hope for our future. We were handed an already ruined planet, but now it is our chance to care and try to lessen the effects to keep this planet habitable. I also felt very dissapointed, but not at all suprised when he mentioned that the poorest countries (3 billion people), only contributed 5% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, yet are reaping the same, if not stronger, consequences. The facts that the developed countries got to reap the benefits of fossil fuels, yet everyone has to suffer the same consequences seems so vastly unfair to me. Environmental justice seems to be a very interesting topic and I am excited to learn more about it.

<p>
While nice to hear, I am not looking for an apology. In fact, I think it is this approach that leads to the controversial qualities of the climate crisis. When people start pointing fingers, whether away from or towards themselves, it causes polarization among the people who should be on the same side of the current climate crisis. When people bring feelings and inter-generational relations into the mix of an already difficult situation, it gives rise to a full new category of struggles within the problem. While the main focus of the climate crisis should fall on the "Oh boy, what're we going to do about this?", pointing fingers and blaming older generations shifts the focus to a much less productive place. 
<br><br>
The blame game also causes many members of older generations to grow defensive instead of open to the topic of climate change. Humans, as a species, don't like to be on the hot seat in terms of trouble. It can hurt to have a few people mad at you, and it can be crippling to have a full generation of youths mad at you. A lot of people respond to trouble by trying to find a way out of it, and for many people the easiest way out is through disassociating yourself from the problem. You could do this either by claiming you did not partake in using any modern day technology (a bold claim), or you could try and disregard or discredit the validity of the climate crisis, which we see a lot of the older generations doing. 
<br><br>
My point is this: We should all be on the same side of this problem. Essentially, it is us vs. the situation we find ourselves in. While the situation may have been handed down to us and may have been avoidable, that is not where we should be placing our thoughts. We should reserve our thinking for solutions; we should be working together to find ways to overcome our unfortunate situation and move forward towards a better future.

I found it very interesting that the climate crisis is primarily identified as a generational issue by Ken. It was fascinating to hear about the impact that our actions today will have on the people of the future. What was also interesting was the fact that many of the individuals that are responsible for the climate issues that we face today are still alive. It is appalling that such horrendous acts against humanity can be written off as they have.

<p>
I find the comparison extremely true of how if you pour a quart of oil down the drain, the consequences will be obvious as it will quickly contaminate the water but if you release a billion times that co2 in the atmosphere, there is little impact throughout the earth which makes it seem like it will not have that huge of an impact anywhere. The fact is, people did not think that the consequences would be as severe as they currently are at that is due to the time delay. It is incredibly important to note that had people had known just how much it would affect the earth today, perhaps they would not have been so careless. The part that was brought up too about how in the past 60 years, in the professor's lifetime alone, the co2 levels in the air had risen by 100 ppm is so scary and shows just how dire of a situation that we are currently living in. If we continue on like this, there will be no world for us to save for our kids and the future generations that will have been born into this life that they had absolutely no say in how the world would be. It is so scary to think that my children and my grandchildren will face these harmful effects that the older generations will not even have to suffer because they will no longer be here to face the consequences of their own actions. 
<br><br>
I also feel that it is so unfair to the people of the underdeveloped countries who do not even contribute to these carbon emissions, however, they will be the ones to suffer the most from the poor conditions that they live in, while the top percentage of the population will be able to live lavishly and not even face the consequences of everything that they did to the atmosphere and the world. This delayed response is something that we need to fix quickly and urgently.

<p>
These lecture videos are a wake up call for us to realize that our earth is suffering. It’s hard to believe that the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere is multiplying at a much faster rate within our lifetime. I feel as though as humans we aren’t taking action because it’s not directly affecting us especially if you come from a developed country that has resources. Most of the time it’s the industrialized countries that contribute towards climate change and the underdeveloped countries have to suffer the consequences. Most believe that ignorance is a bliss but fail to realize that this issue affects us all. It does not matter where you live or where you come from, it affects us all.

<p>
It is very frustrating when you want to have an important educational conversation with people from older generations on the topic of climate change, due to the reason that most boomers I meet are very conservative for whatever reason that might be. From my experiences, the conversations I’ve encountered with boomers are hardly ever in concordance with each other. Many of them are not realizing that our earth is undergoing catastrophic changes right before our eyes. Many believe that global warming is a hoax, that there is no way our earth is warming when it's so cold outside, that we can adapt to these changes if they are happening - all of these are absurd responses that these nonbelievers come up with. So when I watched Ken’s first video, “The climate crisis as a generation issue,” I appreciated the fact that Ken made clear to the fact that the changes in our climate started with the older generation and now us, the younger generation, not only must face these severe changes but we also have to be the ones to fix it in order for the children of future generations to live. 
<br><br>
But instead of complaining and being angry and frustrated with the older generation, we must start changing our lifestyles beginning today, right now. We must educate those who are oblivious to our climate crisis and let it be known that we are the ones causing severe damage to our earth and that our future isn't looking very bright at the rate we are going. We must continue to educate ourselves and others on what we can do to help reverse this damage. I learned so much in just the two lecture videos and the film “Before the flood” ; that is just three videos. Now imagine how much more I will learn throughout the course and how I can take all this information and use it to my advantage to inform others, to make changes to my lifestyle, all for the better of the planet - for the better of us if we want to live in a healthy sustainable world.

<p>
As it was pointed out in this lecture, I find it almost unbelievable that 3/4th's of the CO2 in the world today has been produced since 1959. I think this is why my generation is so angry and motivated about the issue of climate change because of the fact that the most adamant climate change deniers are the ones that made the most damage to the issue  and that leaves my generation to not only deal with the effects but also advocate that this is a real issue and we need real solutions. I also appreciate that Ken not only apologizes about his generation causing a lot of damage within the climate crisis but also apologizes for passing on the fossil fuel addiction that still riddles the generation today. I think the only way to really advocate for change to reverse the effects of climate change is to cross generations so that we are in agreement for what needs to be done, because climate change is going to affect everyone not just the youth of today.
</p><hr>

<p>
From some perspective, I think the climate crisis issue is also an issue of morality: what people choose and at what expense. For many years people have been making the wrong choice that could only benefit them but harm thousands of others. Unfortunately, it still continues today. So many influential people from different areas of industries and governments are getting bonuses for cooperating with big oil companies because the decisions they make affect their sponsors. Sad to see that this is actually the world we are living in --- one of corruption, greediness, and manipulation at the expense of those who did almost nothing.
<br><br>
This makes me think of how important being informed of the reasons and possible outcomes of climate change actually is. From where I am from, there is little attention paid to this problem from both society's and government's sides, and I can't help but notice so many people showing their discontent and disagreement with few climate change activists who try to spread the importance of and urge to solve this problem. Therefore, at the very birth, such activism groups are being criticized, which further prevents others from joining. And even those who might share the same opinions on the climate would be dubious in making their decisions due to the pressure of others. This means that such groups are not being heard in society, and even showing some awareness can lead to bullying.
<br><br>
Many people of my generation are looking towards working for oil companies because that's what brings the most "happiness." They were taught to use the Earth's resources for their benefit and were not taught the effects of such benefits on their future and the future of their children. Indeed, if they were well informed, would they still prefer their capital over the lives of others or choose the morally correct way?

<p>
In these two lectures, the question about the side effects of global warming and large amount release of CO2 is shown from generations to generations. It is not something you do bad and the consequences will shown in tomorrow. It is something that you done bad today and the consequences will be shown in the future. The idea that showing late does not mean it does not come. The smoking example is very vivid that everyone knows smoking is bad, and the fact is that smoking cigarettes today will not make you feel sick tomorrow. All the little bad consequences will add up in the future and bring severe damages to you. If we agree with this theory, there is no differences between the smoking and the CO2 release. 
<br><br>
Nowadays, it is a good symbol that young people starts to realize this issue. Last generations' bad actions will bring bad consequences. It is a big step for young generations to realize compare to the last generations when people generally think the global warming it is a false topic. It is the first step for us to realize it and the next step would be crucial to act it. We still have time to act but we do not have a lot of it. 
<br><br>
Also, what is ironic that United State only have 4% of the world but the CO2 release is 25%. The poorest 3 billion people, almost 50% of the world, only have a few percentage of release of CO2. It is important for us because we are the most influenced country in this issue in the world.

</p><hr>

<p>
It was really interesting to hear that developed countries produced 66% of the world’s CO2 emissions while undeveloped countries only produced 5% of it. This comes to show how developed countries, mainly the U.S., have been carelessly evolving to a point where it is starting to affect the environment around them and it is continuing to grow and spread. Developed countries are really in an era where they are living lavishly thinking nothing is going to happen to them: that may be the case, but their children will be affected and if not, their children’s children will. This kind of thinking is what has allowed the climate crisis situation to spiral out of proportion. It is scary to hear that the current generation could produce the most amount of CO2 placed upon our atmosphere in a span of 20 years.
</p><hr>

<p>
“The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” both effectively portray the fact that climate change is largely caused by one generation of people, and steps haven’t been taken to slowdown our footprint. It is only increasing. It is so shocking that in the past 60, years, carbon dioxide has risen by 100 ppm. This means that fossil fuel companies are quickly turning this world into a warzone, figuratively and literally. Regular people like us must be heard so that the people in higher up political positions have no other option but to address the situation. 
<br><br>
In addition, I am so shocked by the quote, “The poorest three billion people on the planet contributed just 5 percent of the CO2 in the atmosphere.” This clearly depicts the great injustices that the developed world is causing. The poorer people who didn’t cause the problem of climate change will suffer greatly, while people who caused it will hide behind their wealth and technology for some period of time. Learning that even climate change won’t treat everyone equally paints the picture of just how corrupt our world can be, and how little some people care. 
<br><br>
Now, climate change is a problem that my generation will be tasked with fixing, and I am unsure that we can do anything but slow the catastrophic effects, but we must do that for the future generations. We will not go down without a fight.
</p><hr>

<p>
The metaphor Ken uses in this lecture about indulging in destructive behavior like cigarette smoking highlights the reason why many of those who fall into the gen z and millennial category are upset at older generations. They chose to smoke the metaphorical cigarettes, leaving their kids, grandkids, and all of society to suffer the consequences. To make it all the more enraging, some baby boomers have the audacity to neglect the idea that climate change is real and upon us. That being said, I know there are many boomers who are aware of what their generation has cultivated and are working alongside younger generations to make changes towards a more environmentally conscious future. The fact that 75% of CO2 emissions were created during Ken’s lifetime is really telling of the factors that play a role in the climate crisis and prove that my generation have inherited this earth in a deteriorating state to no fault of our own. 
<br><br>
Ken’s lecture also highlighted that the United States holds most of the weight when it comes to contributing to climate change, however, feel the least consequences compared to developing countries. Very few people have the power to make decisions, but their decisions affect all of American society and the societies of other countries. Because of this, we have to make sure that systems being put in place have the well-being of all humanity in mind because ultimately, we need empathy to battle climate change.
</p><hr>

<p>
It is very eye-opening to see just how much CO2 that humans have put into the atmosphere within 50 years. Climate change deniers that look at how global temperatures have risen and fallen for the duration of Earth's lifetime do not pay attention to the quickly rising numbers of CO2 in our atmosphere. There is no rising and falling pattern to it. There is plenty of evidence that CO2 levels have been exponentially rising since Shakespeare's time, yet there are still people who do not believe that climate change was caused by humans and our actions.
<br><br> 
Learning that the poorest three billion people contribute only 5% to carbon emissions is shocking when the US alone contributes one-third of carbon emissions, even though only 4% of the world's population lives here. There are those who blame these three billion people for not having the resources to live sustainably, but many of them do not even have access to the resources that are the main contributors of carbon emissions. Even if I did not know the evidence behind these statistics, I still do not think that I would be surprised that the US produces this much CO2. Money is powerful and is made a priority over the planet's wellbeing and the future generations that will have to deal with the repercussions of our actions. 
<br><br>
I have always believed that climate change is real, but when I started learning about living sustainably many years ago, I could not imagine doing it. I would like to think that I have come a long way since then and hope that more people will too once they realize that it is not as difficult as it may seem. It is unfair that the generation before us has left us with this mess to fix, but we might as well be the generation to save the Earth, make life better for future generations, and carry on living sustainable lifestyles so that we do not go down this road again.
</p><hr>

<p>
Some say that time heals all wounds, but with climate change, time was the main cause of the previous generations’ negative behavior. I found it fascinating to hear that Ken believes that the time delay of CO2’s repercussions was the key factor in the ignorance of those in the generation before us. The smoking analogy that Ken brought up illustrates the issue perfectly. People are less likely to care about their behaviors when they are not suffering the consequences, even when their children and generations to come will. Now, since many people who are concerned about climate change are young adults or transitioning into adulthood, we’re faced with difficult situations such as extreme weather patterns, the safety of those who live on the coast, the morality of bringing children into this world in this increasingly uninhabitable world. 
<br><br>
It blows my mind that 75% of the CO2 currently in the atmosphere was released in a 60 year period. Only a quart of oil being poured down a drain can contaminate a million gallons of water, but releasing a billion times that amount into the atmosphere has very little effect. When taking that fact into consideration, it’s clear that the issue of dumping large amounts of CO2 can be easily disregarded as an unimportant matter.
<br><br>
I appreciated Ken’s apology on behalf of himself and his entire generation. Although we can blame them, we must also take some responsibility. Maybe it’s not our fault that this process was started, but we can accept our roles in being the ones to fight against it. We are facing the repercussions of our ancestors’ choices, and we can save ourselves and our descendants from a worse planet than it currently is. In fact, it’s not too late for those in Ken’s generation to realize their mistakes and take steps towards redeeming the environment. I think one thing that we can do is educate our elders about the reality and urgency of climate change, as well as the necessity for all people to do their part in fighting against it.
</p><hr>

<p>
"The climate crisis as a generational issue" and "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" notices many people of a truth that even though they may not experience the bad consequence like from burning fossil fuels themselves, their descendants will, especially about diseases related to kidney, throat problem.  Ken mentions that velocity speed of  releasing CO2 are time than preceding centuries which had led to abundant environmental problems including problems of plants, fish, and insects emerged in recent decades. And Ken's words remind me of things from last quarter that people from the poorest countries are suffering from consequences of massive emission of CO2 but they hardly take participation in emitting, so that we should reconsider our mode of production and try to change maintaining a balance.

It is always appalling to me that humans have managed to cause so much damage to our planet in just a single lifetime. The delayed impact of all the CO2 we have released into our atmosphere has made us ignorant. Naturally, the CO2 in our atmosphere is held at about 280 parts per million, but we have recently been digging up fossil fuels at an alarming rate. In 1959, CO2 had risen to 315ppm, and had continued to rise dramatically and has now reached 415ppm in the year 2019. This is shocking, because this is three times  more than our use in the preceding centuries. There is no reason for our people to be digging up and burning so much fossil fuels. 
<br><br>
It is almost embarrassing being an American because we are the country releasing the most carbon emissions into the atmosphere but we constitute only 4% of the world population. Our materialistic indulgences have cost us our planet. It is actually worrisome that the same things are still being done today. When Professor Hiltner stated that “in the next twenty years, human beings, principally those in the developed world, could put more Co2 in the atmosphere than the human race did for the whole of our history up to the time that I was born,” it really put things into perspective to me. Our planet absolutely cannot afford this and it makes our future look gloom. I cannot imagine what our planet will be like for our future generations, if there even is a future for our planet. Our generation has left us with a planet on its way to becoming largely uninhabitable for our species. Professor Hiltner has made me realize that many of us do have fossil fuel addictions. We casually abuse our planets with unnecessary habits and pleasures. Ken’s guilt seems genuine and has inspired me to look at our current climate crisis in a different li
</p><hr>

<p>
In Ken’s lecture video, he suggests us about emergency and responsibility to take actions for climate change. It is everyone’s ability to make the environment better not only for ourselves but also for our offsprings. Ken gives an example about “cigarettes.” Some behavior may harm both ourselves and our next generations. After we die, the harm will still exist and make the world worse for our next generations. 
<br><br>
Also, when the government keeps developing the industry and improves GDP with sacrificing the environment, people should also realize that what we will finally pay back what we earned from the nature. This topic reminds me of the wild fire in Australia. While the government relied on the natural rainfall to put off the fire, the government should also pay attention to the drought last year. However, losing hundreds of animal species and nature resources, the government has to spend more money to put off the fire with human force now. 
<br><br>
Ken also mentioned a point that it is misleading to blame population as the reason for rise in CO2 level. The problem is about how much each person emitted rather than the number of the people. When some developed countries spent more energy and money in improving national power and economy, they also sacrifice the welfare of their offsprings and precious natural  resources.
</p><hr>

<p>
In the lecture videos, Ken details the impact certain first-world countries have on climate change and also reflects on how his generation was largely responsible for perpetuating the climate crisis. The USA, Russia, and Europe contribute to nearly two-thirds of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere even though they only contain a mere one-eighth of the world’s population. Meanwhile, the poorest three billion people on the earth only contribute to 5% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The lecture “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” really opened my eyes to how the capitalistic greed of first-world countries are bringing about climate change. The fact that the people who started the increase of emissions in Ken’s generation are still alive and continuing today---and are teaching their descendants their ways---is really depressing. These lecture videos helped me understand the climate crisis better and how it has been exponentially worsening these past 60 years or so. I especially liked Ken’s cigarette analogy to demonstrate the butterfly effect of doing climate-harming practices. Dozens of future generations---pretty much all children in the future---will be impacted by what a minority of people are doing right now, and that’s not right. The situation worries me and I feel like it will be too late to make a difference if we do not fight against climate change soon.

I thought that the analogy to smoking and fossil fuels was very strong. Likening it to something most of us know is damaging helps us to understand the severity of our actions in simpler terms. Even if we knew the consequences before, I think that humans would still have fallen to fossil fuels. I feel that the rich would favor comfort over saving the planet for the future generations. It's sickening to know that 1/8th of the population makes up 2/3 of all carbon emissions and when the poorer countries industrialize, the emissions will only increase as they rely of fossil fuels to build the countries. Those people may not even get to live the life that the developed countries live because the effects of climate change will effect them first. Youth protest shows that we know what will happen to us and our future families if nothing gets done. However it doesn't seem that the people in power really care about it because of the money they get from fossil fuel industries to spread misinformation and prevent change from happening.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” I was angry at the fact that a single generation of people caused to much harm to the entire world. What really put things into perspective for me was Ken’s example with smoking. It’s ridiculous how ⅛ people are responsible for most of the damage caused to not only earth, but all the future generations. It’s extremely unfair how the poorest half of the world will feel the worst consequences despite having contributed 5% of co2 emissions, and those who are the most responsible for climate change will be least affected. I think the boomer generation doesn’t want to acknowledge that in only 60 years they caused co2 levels in the atmosphere to rise 100 ppm, because that would mean giving up all the unnecessary commodities we live with today. It’s so crazy to think that one generation of people caused the environmental problems we see today, but it’s even crazier to think that they did it knowingly.
</p><hr>

<p>
The analogy Professor Ken used comparing climate change being caused by an older generation and leaving a younger generation to suffer the consequences to someone smoking as many cigarettes as they want and having their children bare all the consequences from birth really struck me. That is exactly what is happening: an older generation that has contributed vastly to the problem got to reap the benefits and profit from it, leaving all the turmoil and problems for our generation to deal with. They got the pleasure of wealth and a beautiful, healthy Earth, while we are left with the onerous task of attempting to save our dying planet. Something that really shocked me was the fact that a quarter of all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was put there by us, the United States, despite the fact that we only make up four percent of the population. That really struck me. I like to think that I have a low carbon footprint: I am vegetarian, I have grown up in a major metropolitan city where taking the bus and other forms of public transit are preferable to driving a car, I don’t fly on airplanes very often. However, when I took a step back and really thought about the lifestyle that I lead, I realized that so much more of what we do adds immensely to our carbon footprint than we realize. As a teenager in America, I do live a consumeristic lifestyle, filled with fast fashion, a flurry of shirts and shoes and items produced in China, shipped across the world to end up in my closet. I purchase foods grown in other countries, shipped to our grocery stores so that I can have the pleasure of enjoying the fruit that I love even when it is not in it’s growing season here. My car is my father’s old car, a gas-guzzling BMW with gas milage so abysmal I’m embarrassed to say what it is here in this comment. There are changes we can make in our lifestyle to decrease our carbon footprint, and a lot of it is the stuff that we don’t think twice about. This brings up the concept of the consumption overpopulation that we have here in the United States, as opposed to the numbers overpopulation of countries like India. We have fewer people, however, the population we do have here consumes so much more than the average person in every other country. Our consumeristic culture has taught us to want more, more, more, leading us to have a per capita carbon footprint more than 4 times higher than China’s.

In professor Hiltner’s first lecture video, “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” Hiltner shows his audience the truth of the climate crisis. The climate crisis was caused in a very short amount of time, in a lifetime. This is because of the use of fossil fuels, are waste habits, and more. The past generation has failed the earth, and future generations as it has decided to act without consequence, since they themselves were not the ones being affected by these actions. This is shown by the example of smoking cigarettes, which was a very good metaphor for this crisis, especially how he related it to all animals and not just humans. There were some very shocking statistics as well, such as the percent of people who were causing this crisis and how the US was causing 25 percent of the problem with only four percent of the population. Also I can’t believe that we are releasing so much carbon dioxide into the air every year. The projections of this crisis are quite unsettling as well, because these changes are very significant since they would cause much destruction.

</p><hr>


<p>
“The Climate Crisis as a generational issue” implies that the impact of climate change will exacerbate from generation to generation, especially for our future generations. Accordingly, many teenagers engage in the sunrise movement to speak up their voices about the need for immediate action regarding environmental issues. Similar to Professor Hiltner’s “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” future generations will have to undertake the consequences as they born with environmental issues. According to the video, every child born in the next few hundred years would suffer consequences. More importantly, the climate crisis created in this generation requires the public’s awareness and gathering to solve the issue. It is insane that the climate crisis was brought in only a single lifetime, and it affects millions of people. 
<br><br>
Besides, poor people or people who have low social status often take more consequences of climate change, where they have a lack of resources and support from society and government. However, “the poorest 3 billion people on the planet contribute only 5 percent amount of CO2.” Therefore, environmental injustice is a huge concern for the climate crisis.
</p><hr>

<p>
When I heard that the United States only constituted 4% of the world population I had to do the math myself to confirm this was true.  It is not that I did not believe this was true, it was that I was completely appalled by this fact.  I knew that the United States contributed, proportionally, more CO2 to the earth’s atmosphere than any other country; I just did not know this disparity was so large.  What worries me the most is that the carbon footprint of the US is not decreasing because people choose to partake in the same activities they have for their whole lifetimes instead of embracing sustainable alternatives.
<br><br>
The part of the video that struck me the most was the analogy of climate change to a cigarette addiction.  If, in reality, one out of eight people smoking cigarettes had extremely negative consequences on humans for generations to come, the result would be an immediate ban.  Sure, it would take time to adjust to this new lifestyle, but it would be worth saving billions of lives.  However, with climate change, this would be impossible.  Immediately stopping all fossil fuel emissions would probably cause an economic crisis that would affect those in poorer nations much more than those in wealthy nations.  Additionally, those in positions of power are the ones gaining the most from the destruction of the planet so incentive for change is very minimal.  Empathy is so needed yet so lacking.

<p>
As the first video said, we the new generations are pissed, and rebelling, but we are less pissed about what has been done, and more so at the fact that many of those responsible wont admit that they are responsible. If those individuals were to admit their wrong and try to fix it, then there would be little issues and climate change could be slowed or halted. Although our nation presents itself as a model county, and attempts to convince the world that our ideals are supreme, it is often difficult to cope with the fact that our nation often refuses to accept responsibility for the problems it has caused. The fact that the US alone has caused 25% of the cThis culture developed partially due to the self righteous culture many adults grew up with and were taught by there families, and sometimes it does feel nice to at least have an adult admit that they were a part of the problem. I forsee a future in which a similar method to Superfund sites must be created globally to help clean up the mess of companies who commit crimes against the climate. These individuals who denied the effects they have will cut and run when they see they can no longer continue, and because they have less of their life left to live, being adults, they will leave the world and its problems to the future generations as the videos said (I quite liked the smoker metaphor). We appreciate your apology, yet your generation as a whole does not share your views, and for that I am sorry.

<p>
In the first lecture, Ken explains how many youth movements are now rising up to protest against climate change and are agitated that we are not taking decisive steps to fix the issue when we had the chance. Many young people are frustrated that they are now living on a planet that is slowly decaying, and some are still denying that global warming is our biggest issue. 
<br><br>
In the second lecture, Ken states that global warming was never an issue that started generations ago, but rather an issue that happened in a lifetime. However, Ken provides an optimistic mindset and states that we have time to still mobilize and fight global warming together. 
<br><br>
Ken also addressed the reason why the climate crisis continued to grow over the years, yet no one stopped and thought of ways to stop it before it became too large of an issue. Over the years, we continued to release greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and always told ourselves that there would be no problem. However, as we release more and more carbon dioxide, the impact is felt everywhere around the planet. In addition, because there is a time delay between the greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere and the actual impact, few actually noticed this issue. Ken uses an example of smoking cigarettes to support this stance. He explains how when one first starts smoking cigarettes, there is no immediate impact to their health. However, this would, over time, affect the people around the person smoking, including their children and other family members.

<p>
The rise in CO2 composition in our atmosphere is truly alarming. No doubt, everyone should act now to save our planet. But reducing one's carbon emissions is complicated. Take me as an example, my home is on the other side of the planet, every summer and winter I have to make a round trip across the world to be able to see my family and spend time with them. I cannot not see my family anymore, it's one of my basic rights. But there are improvements in the field of lithium-ion battery that may lead to electric planes, there might not be enough battery for a plane to fly across the pacific ocean, but for short flights in the US, it's totally viable in the near future. I believe it takes all of us to solve this problem, scientists and normal people. We can change our lifestyle to reduce our carbon footprint, but sometimes the compromises are just too big or keep reducing is just not an option. But this is just for a portion of the world. 
<br><br>
Underdeveloped countries are still working to better improve their citizen's lives, this may or may not lead to more carbon emissions. They are going to need help from the developed world to help jump over the fossil burning stage and straight to sustainable energy. This already happened in India.
</p><hr>

<p>
In the lecture of “How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime”, what stood out to me most was that I began to think about how within my own lifetime, it could very well be too late. In 1959, almost no one was worrying about the effects of our nation’s fossil fuel addiction. In 2020, more and more people are becoming aware, but the number of people worried enough about the climate crisis is growing relatively slowly compared to the exponential growth of the amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases being released into our atmosphere. It is terrifying to me, an 18 year old girl who had considered bringing new life into this Earth, that that may not be a reality for me. Within the next 20 years, there is no telling what will happen and how bad this problem will become. It worries me that the generation before me acted so recklessly, and as Professor Hiltner put it, has taught my very own generation to act. The consequences are catching up to us, rapidly, and yet we continue the cycle and patterns that have brought us to this point. I was also taken aback hearing Professor Hiltner’s apology. It is very unusual for people of the generation before mine to take responsibility for their actions. Actions that have caused the climate crisis. Most people, young and old, choose to ignore the problem because it is more comfortable to remain acting the way they have their whole lives. It makes me feel hopeful that there are people who were part of the problem that are on our side and willing to fight for a solution to secure our future.
</p><hr>

<p>
Professor Hiltner’s videos, “The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue” and “How the Climate Crisis was Brought about in a Single Lifetime”, highlight how fast the climate crisis has been created and consequently how important it is that we address it immediately. It is hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from 280 to 415 ppm in just a single generation, and that this number will only continue to exponentially increase unless immediate action is taken to stop burning fossil fuels at the current rate. It also appals me that some of the wealthiest nations, who arguably have the most power to reverse the climate crisis, are contributing the most to the problem and the least to the solution.
<br><br>
I thought Professor Hiltner’s analogy of the impact of cigarettes to the impact of climate change was extremely effective in showing us how climate change will affect future generations immensely and negatively if we do not act now. However, I believe that rather than blaming past generations for the damage that has been done, we need to put our effort to making sure that we do not make those same mistakes. In the same way that taxing cigarettes brought about positive change by lowering consumption, a carbon tax has the potential to do the same. It is imperative that we take such actions, no matter what they are, to ensure that our children do not have to look back and see irreversible damage we caused.
</p><hr>


<p>
“The climate crisis as a generational issue” is an intro video that shows the current generation of youth attempting to take action in the climate crisis as the older generation did not. In the lecture video “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” Professor Hiltner goes over the reasons why his generation have not and did not take action in fighting the climate crisis. The analogy that he used with the cigarettes to convey the idea of delayed consequences and the reason why his generation was not afraid of their actions is very clear. Learning that 1/8th of the world’s population including places like the U.S., Europe, and Russia, contribute nearly 2/3rds of the CO2 in the atmosphere and that the poorest three billion people in the world only contribute 5% of the CO2 was pretty shocking and is terrible. It is great that many youth are taking action in the climate crisis, and as the issues of the climate crisis spreads, hopefully more people will join in on the effort to fight climate change.

<p>
After watching, "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime", I am shocked to learn that in the last 60 years we have risen  our CO2 emissions by 100 points and it took the people before us about 350 years since the first recorded history of using fossil fuel to get to 300 parts. I can not believe that we have added 75% of the Co2 into the atmosphere. Even though we can still save our planet, watching this video makes me worry what will happen if we don't act soon? Who knows what our planet will look like if we don't act now. It is also crazy to me how the richest people and countries are creating all the CO2 in the atmosphere and we are blaming it on the poor countries.  They are getting the blame for things that we need to change. I find it touching that Ken apologized/took blame on behalf of his generation and now is trying to join us in something to do to change it!

</p><hr>

<p>
“The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”  touches on the topic of how the current generation coming into maturity is left to pick up the pieces left behind by preceding generations that allowed for the destruction of our earth. In the last 60 years the Co2 levels have risen exponentially and if no radical efforts are taken to stop the pollution Co2 will rise another 45 points, more than the what was increased in the years before the last 60 years. The United States is responsible for ⅓ of the Co2 that goes into our atmosphere which is upsetting when you realize that the people most affected are the poorest 3 billion people that only account for 5 percent of the pollution. To live guilt free much of the united states live behind the fossil fuel economy which helps run the comfortable life that cushion many from real world problems most of the word faes. Thanks to the passion of the younger generations coming into maturity this guilt is being felt and acted upon , we see much more push and drive for reform, rallies where passionate hearts are heard voicing concerns for humanity as a whole. And As part of this younger generation we accept your apology and are happy to have you on our team supporting positive change in the world.

<p>
The lectures “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" were very informational on how humans have contributed to the current climate crisis. In a single decade, we have created so many problems due to industrialization. Humans have prioritized making profit from the environment rather than care for it. Large companies have destroyed eco systems in order to derive its resources. Millions of species of animals have gone extinct due to environmental destruction. 
<br><br>
A really interesting point I learned was that 4% of the US population have contributed to the high amount of carbon emissions the atmosphere. Hearing this was very shocking because America tends to blame third world countries for global warming in mass media. However, the United States is in fact the culprit. We have finances to begin solving the climate crisis, but choose to invest in oil plantations and burning more fossil fuels to support industrialization. Third world countries suffer the most from environmental damage because they don't have the resources or finances to combat these problems. The wealthy seek the benefits of industrialization while millions continue to suffer. 
 <br><br>
I hope the current generation is compassionate enough to recognize the current problems within our society that contribute to the environmental crisis.
</p><hr>

<p>
I have a lot of thoughts about these lectures. And a lot of emotions. Instead of trying to explain my point, I’m going to try to show it. I was driving in the car with my grandpa this summer, driving up and down the mountain area he lives in, talking about climate change. I was telling him everything I knew: all the science, the politics, the predictions, the points for hope. I told him about my fears, and my optimism. He told me he thought it was fascinating, and he’d be interesting to see how I solved it. Me. “I’m eighteen. I know jack shit about how to fix this. You started this, why couldn’t you fix it?” 
<br><br>
That is the most useless and self pitying train of thought anyone could possibly take. Is it frustrating: yes. Is it the most unproductive thing I could possibly do: absouletelty. Yes, we kind of got screwed over by the past generation. Yeah, we have to fix what they started. But wasting time being angry about that doesn’t fix the problem that we’ve been benefiting off of our entire lives. I was so angry and self-righteous I didn’t even think about all the gas I was using to drive aimlessly around a neighborhood that was distrupting the local ecosystem. Of course it’s messed up, and scary, and daunting. But there are so many people out there committed to preserving the future, from all generations. Moral of the story: look foward.
</p><hr>

<p>
It is crazy to me how the older generation has chosen their own self interest over the survival of the future generations. It is basically murdering and disabling our future because that is what is going to happen if we don’t save our planet. Since the older generation won’t help to save our planet, I am proud that our generation is making a stand. My only fear, however, is that it is too late. We can scream and shout about which policies need to change, but if no one in our government cooperates, there is little we can do. I agree that we should continue to keep advocating to eventually make ourselves heard, but we need help.
<br><br>
I think of it like having a friend over. If you have a friend over who makes a mess of your room, you would expect them to help you clean up. The previous generation has made a mess of our planet by accounting for creation of ¾ of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, yet they aren’t doing their part to help remedy the issue. Again it makes me so upset that this issue has only been made worse, but it is on us to fix the problem ourselves. Our generation is charged with holding the line between a ruined future and a sustainable one, so it is our job to learn as much as we can about the issues involved with climate change and make it known to the public in order to do all we can in fixing the problem. By knowing more we are already taking the issue a step further than the last generation that argues with each other if we are actually in a climate crisis. This is also why it is important to learn from the past generation in order to not repeat the same mistakes that got us in this mess.
</p><hr>

<p>
The two videos "The climate crisis as a generational issue" and "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime," illustrate the speed of such an impending issue, that is the climate. Referencing specifics as 1959, and the steady increase in PPM, as well as the amount of CO2 being rapidly burned and drilled, the increased interest in such an issue has been heavily impacted by such statistics. The analogy of the cigarette smoking and negative assumptions provided by such, are helpful into putting into perspective the damage that is being done on a comparable scale. This being in that the stemming ramifications from smoking a cigarette and effects of second hand smoke and/or birth defects, help to illustrate the that yes, while not immediate, it will become a pressing issue as time goes on. 
<br><br>
The realization in professor's voice of not only his generations impact, but also the dormant actions or policies put forward, as he commits to us his wish to make change illustrates way too common of a thought. That being in the 'it isn't my issue' viewpoint, and generational divide over fighting for change. 
<br><br>
As our country itself is so heavily reliant on oil, consumer owned vehicles and and array of other often interest based policies, divisions between power and money, and activism and change can be difficult to navigate. This is why the interest and seriousness that scientific data is analyzed and actually impacted upon will be interesting to see.
</p><hr>

<p>
Before watching the two lectures, I knew that Americans have put large amounts of CO2 into the air. It was when I learned that 3 billion of the world’s population only put 5% of CO2 into the air that I was completely disgusted. Our country is taking advantage of the oil industry and using it to build more and more instead of focusing on helping the third world countries. We have been conditioned to want more than we need and the things we think we need, we actually don’t. The United States is more worried about having the most power and money in the world. 
<br><br>
I appreciate Ken’s apology for his generation’s impact on our future. I would also like to point out how he said we will wait a long time for the government’s apology since they keep pulling us out of agreements and supporting the oil industry. The reason they do not care or believe in climate change is because they are not the ones feeling to effects. My generation and my children’s generation will be paying the cost of their actions. The problem with this is that we also do not want to give up our materialistic things due to the social standards that are set. Many are conflicted because it is environmentally better to take the bus instead of driving their nice cars around. There will need to come to a point where there is more emphasis on the climate than someone’s wants. The idea of publicizing the harmful effects of oil and gas like the negative effects of cigarettes are publicized was an amazing idea. That might be the only way to get the message across to the average American.
</p><hr>

<p>

I find it insane that the climate crisis was literally brought about in a single life time. It’s just crazy to see how far we have let it come to be and I understand that the consequences of using fossil fuels are delayed but they should have researched it more. Too much of anything is bad for you so what made them think that using too much fossil fuels wouldn’t have a terrible effect?
<br><br>
Three quarters of CO2 was released in a lifetime of some people and it’s just insane to hear about. The effects of CO2 were to some extent seen in Shakespeare’s London yet we willingly and gleefully continued to use fossil fuels. I find it disheartening to see that my home country produced a quarter of CO2 emissions that will be affecting the poorest 3 billion people who barely contributed any! The U.S. claims to be a peacekeeper for the world but will be in fact one of the biggest contributors of all the damage that is to come to human civilization. I look forward to the solutions that Professor Ken will bring about in future lessons.
</p><hr>

<p>
This video is a real eye-opener for all generations. I was shocked to find out that the United States is the main contributor to CO2 emissions. This means that we burn the most fossil fuels and do not care for our atmosphere. In the atmosphere, CO2 has increased in ppm by 100 in the last 60 years, which is a major increase from previous years. CO2 emissions are increasing exponentially, meaning more impactful consequences are likely to come. Another point I thought was interesting was that poor people accounted for only 5% of the CO2 emissions, showing that the wealthy are selfish and burn fossil fuels thinking only of the money aspect, and not eh environmental consequences. This issue is very important and needs to be addressed immediately. If we continue to burn fossil fuels and contribute to the CO2 emissions, our future generations are doomed. Our older generation did not take action on this cause, resulting in increasingly worse consequences that shouldn't have occurred. If we want to save our Earth and future generations of life, including plants and animals, we need find alternatives for fossil fuels and decrease pollution. I feel that most people do not know the extent of these consequences and should be informed of so.
</p><hr>

<p>
The videos “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” discusses who is responsible for climate change and why it has been allowed to go on for so long.  Delayed effects of the carbon emissions released into the atmosphere contributed to why we continued to pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Older generations burned fossil fuels at an alarming rate and although they did know that they were harming the environment, I don’t think most of the population was aware of the severity of the damage they were doing. This resulted in the younger generation being stuck with a rapidly changing climate due to the actions of their predecessors. In addition, there is a significant amount of injustice present when observing who was responsible for the carbon emissions and who will feel the effects of the changing climate. This is something that will only get worse with the problem as the poorest 3 billion people in the world contributed only 5% of the emissions but yet won’t have access to resources to address the problems they will encounter concerning the climate. It is up to our generation to combat climate change and the resulting inequalities.
</p><hr>

<p>
Short-term gain vs. long-term gain. That is what I invariably ask myself whenever my mind thinks about the climate crisis and that is what I was thinking about throughout the entirety of this video. The short-term gain is trivial because the benefits are immediate and the harmful effects are felt later. Whereas, the long term-gain is trivial as the benefits are felt later and the sacrifice is felt immediately. Ken intelligently touches upon this point through his analogy of the consumption of cigarettes. Cigarettes are all fun and games until you are diagnosed with lung cancer and then you ask yourself was that short burst of consumption of cigarettes worth the suffering of cancer. Most likely your answer would be no. This is very much applicable to the cause and effect of the climate crisis. The burning of fossil fuels leading to outrageous amounts of carbon emissions can be likened to the effects of cigarette consumption. However, the difference between cigarette consumption and the burning of fossil fuels is that everyone is affected by the burning of fossil fuels. As Ken mentioned in the video the population of the poorest percentile will be largely affected by the burning of fossil fuels even though the majority of the carbon emissions were by the 4% of the Earth's population. How does that seem fair?
</p><hr>

<p>
The analogy Ken uses to convey the impact climate change has on the human population is absolutely fantastic. It perfectly addresses how the climate crisis affects people of different socio-economic backgrounds in a disproportionate manner, as well as encompasses the negative connotations that should come with polluting in excess. Especially because smoking tends to affect people and families in poverty more than those who are well off.
<br><br>
It's utterly depressing how improbable it is for a proper solution to be agreed upon by the entire world. If America, who is responsible for 25% of all emissions, decided to cut out fossil fuels completely, that would still leave 75% that we have no control over. And even then, going cold turkey is almost impossible when considering how deep our carbon rich lifestyle is ingrained in our society. The only way to truly combat the climate crisis is by altering not only how our society functions, but the very source of our habits. With that in mind, I'm incredibly excited to see Ken's proposal for fighting climate change.

The video “how the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” is a very touching brilliant work. The analogy of smoking is particularly powerful. I can feel a lot of sadness since people are knowingly damaging the environment. At the end of this video, Ken apologized to us on behalf of his generation which I found extremely powerful. However, I do not think that any single generation is responsible for global warming, because everyone is responsible. The climate issue we have today is caused by overharvesting natural resources such as fossil fuels. And our high-carbon lifestyle is an outcome of binge enjoying modern technology. Therefore, I would rather see the climate problem as a negative byproduct of enjoyment technologies than a mistake.
<br><br>
My point is that it might be necessary for our civilization to experience this disastrous stage to evolve into the "next level" where the environment and technology are at balance. (Crazily, I am imagining there might be other more advanced alien civilizations who experienced similar problems out there.) We definitely messed our atmosphere up. But we can feel more relieved if we view this event as an opportunity to advance our culture. Be optimistic about curing earth.

I feel similarly in that no one generation should take the responsibility of global warming. As a student, his apology was particularly appreciated, however, it is more important for everyone to hold themselves accountable now, than to shift blame for the climate crisis. I believe there are many steps people can take, such as reducing their carbon footprint by commuting with public transportation, reducing meat ingestion, and buy shopping secondhand. Many people believe in a mechanical solution for climate change through geoengineering, yet, we fail to reconsider the consumptive lifestyle developed countries uphold. By shifting to more sustainable lifestyles, we promote the idea of voluntary simplicity, which promotes self sustenance. 
<br><br>
I imagine that the earth has already entered the "disastrous stage" considering all of the rampant natural disasters occurring throughout the world. The planet could be bettered if people were more considerate about their ecological footprint. The only way for this to happen would be to continue to spread information, like the lecture above.

Showing how the climate crisis was even allowed to happen in the first place as a result of one generation's actions emphasizes the need of this current generation to educate and take action. The imagery and analogy of how smoking five packs of cigarettes without any consequences for yourself but the worst case possible for your kids is heartbreaking in the sense that the past has ignored this decay, this “addiction” so to say, but instead of being addicted to cigarettes, it's consumption in the form of fossil fuel and corruption in the office. As Hiltner states, we’re harming the future of people who haven’t done anything to harm the earth. The poor suffer the actions of a greedy country eager, driven by profit rather than morality and health. 
<br><br>
Hiltner’s apology at the end of the video was heartbreaking to say the least, but motivational in the sense that we’re finally at a point where everyone is finally being aware of the issue, especially this generation.
</p><hr>

<p>
I have always felt the generational aspect of the climate crisis when it came to discussing different environmental matters with my family members. Don’t get me wrong, I love hooking my family up with resources and links about climate change and current disasters and even fun vegetarian/vegan dishes. But it does feel a little disappointing that we were born into what is the most important issue of our lives and that will not only shape our focus of jobs, interests, and passions, it will also leave us working our asses off to try and fix what has been done.
</p><hr>

<p>
This is an irony. Under the United States' constitution, we have the right with liberty and justice for all while we have committed such an injustice and built our nation upon it. The Americans do have the right to do whatever they want,  but the things they are doing are unfair to others. When the Americans only have four percent of the population, they have contributed such a vast amount of carbon emissions when the poorest three billion have only contributed 5% I was shocked by that. Since the people who are suffering from climate-changing are the poor. The American is wealthy. We enjoy the benefit, but we let the poor to help us to sustain the consequences. This is not fair for the poor and violance the value we believe: with liberty and justice for all. 
<br><br>
I like the two examples you provide in the video, smoking, and lack of actions. I think these examples greatly reflex the truthness of climate change. This makes us have to face it and no more delay.
</p><hr>

<p>
I'm strangely relieved to learn that the climate crisis was brought on in one lifetime, through the horrors of mass production, capitalism, and unsustainable food and fuel industries. Why am I relieved? Because, the effects of these human, or rather inhumane, practices are interconnected and are clear cut evidence that show how the way in which we are currently allowing our societies to be run is self destructive and unsustainable. Of course, the fault lies in those who support these industries. The argument of the delayed impact, especially used alongside of the analogy of smoking cigarettes,  sets into perspective how the crisis has been avoided and postponed. I'm also glad this video also mentions how some places are already being clearly affected by pollution and temperature rising. The fact that we probably haven't even seen the effects of the PPM of CO2 in 1959 is alarming, considering it has increased by 100 ppm in 60 years. Those effects will be even more alarming.
</p><hr>

<p>
This lecture explains how the climate crisis really stemmed from former generations who were unaware and oblivious to the effects of CO2 emissions. What I found very interesting is how consequences of atmospheric CO2 have a delayed effect. I found the analogy to cigarette smoking most helpful. Professor Ken explained how an individual who smokes may not be initially harming themselves, but the second hand smoke they produce could harm the health of their children and produce a chain effect. This is similar to the climate crisis. While in the past the CO2 may have no been an issue, it's our generation that is suffering the horrific consequences. 
<br><br>
Professor Ken used the data from the year he was born, 1959 to further stress the rise of CO2 emissions. While the number was 315ppm in 1959, its now risen to 415ppm- a dramatic increase. At the end of this lecture, Professor Ken makes an apology about his generation kick-starting this new reality. I think that although this new generation is much more politically active on this matter, could still do a better job on being more efficient about their own CO2 use, and carbon footprint. I have been pescatarian for many years now, and know that by not eating land meat, I significantly reduce my carbon footprint. I hope my peers also have ways of reducing their's too.

</p><hr>

<p>
In the lecture “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” Ken does an excellent job of pointing out why a generation sat ideally by as they continued to pollute their planet and how their actions have affected those who were most vulnerable and innocent in creating the present issues. The statistic that the poorest 3 billion people in the world are only responsible for 5% of the emissions shocked me. It's incredibly frustrating too that it will be those 3 billion people that will suffer the most as the consequences from our actions escalate. Ironically the most developed countries with the greatest carbon footprint will not suffer as much due to the money they have made off of fossil fuel industries. 
<br><br>
I thought Ken’s metaphor with the cigarettes was both interesting and impactful. It reminded me of a book I read last year called “Merchants of Doubt” that focused on how scientists profited by withholding and construing evidence on a range of issues like climate change and the danger of cigarettes. It seems history is repeating itself today as people profit off of dangerous fossil fuels and lies the same way that scientists did by hiding the truth in the past.
</p><hr>

<p>
English 23: The first of the two videos "The Climate Crisis as a generational issue" is a direct result of the second video. What I mean by this is since the generation that preceded us did not take the threat of climate change seriously, we are the ones that need to make drastic changes to our lives so that we don't do the same thing to our own kids and grandkids. The reason why our generation is important to the change is because the generations of people that are older than we are still don't care/ don't believe in global warming and climate change. This is incredibly frustrating because some of the people with the most power in our country aren't willing to take the necessary steps to creating change. 
<br><br>
When you Ken used his lifetime as the timeline for changes in CO2 emissions, it opened my eyes to just how quickly things had changed. When thinking about my own lifetime,  the CO2 in the atmosphere has raised over 40ppm. With the average life expectancy where it is, people in my generation could contribute to it growing nearly 200 ppm by the time we die. The time delay that Ken talks about is very true in my opinion. I think it is similar to the way tobacco was treated as something not too dangerous before it was found to be very toxic and the cause of many health issues. So now, since we are aware of everything going on in our climate, we need to be the ones that make a difference and lead the charge for change. I am looking forward to learning much more in this course.
</p><hr>

<p>
Perhaps the most compelling point that ken makes for me is the inequitable distribution of our Carbon dioxide emissions. By putting the distribution in terms of countries responsible, it was quite surprising to see how little of the carbon dioxide emissions have actually been contributed by the poorest people. This is quite alarming because the majority of climate related consequences for humans will first be seen by the people that have the least resources to adapt. 
<br><br>
Perhaps the worst part, is that this has really only happened in within a lifetime. It makes me think that perhaps the first and most important step to dealing with climate crisis related issues is for those responsible to acknowledge their role and accept accountability for their actions. This is difficult because those responsible are part of an older generation and will not likely be the ones to solve the problem. Even though the people of our younger generations are not the reason we are in the climate crisis, they have been raised on the culture that created it. I feel that it is still the responsibility of those in the most carbon dioxide polluting countries to spearhead the climate change solutions like we've seen with global youth climate movement.
</p><hr>

<p>
The climate crisis is on a continuous rise today. Ken's lecture videos does a great job of outlining the effects of our future. Sadly, the past generation created a climate crisis for our generation and other generations to come. A quarter of all the CO2 put in the atmosphere was from the United States and only 5% was from the poorest countries. It is frustrating to see the countries that are involved in the climate change the least are the ones that are being affected the most. The analogy of smoking a cigarette was a very creative connection. People are selfish and care about what they want, disregarding their surroundings. They only act if their interest is challenged, just like how cigarettes show negative effects on their body.  We are the last generation that change the course of this climate crisis. The power is in our hands and we need to take action so that our children and future generations can experience a healthy environment.
</p><hr>

<p>
I feel the smoking analogy was extremely well thought and explained. It very well explains the idea of the actions of few having a large effect on many.  I find it sort of a shame in the end that the US, champion of the world and protector of all can contribute to such a process and largely deny it. As Professor Hiltner noted, by living in the developed world, us Americans can almost shield ourselves from the harm that Climate Change causes (for now). Where as much of the world,  which had nothing to do with the process,  suffers for what we have done. The figures baffle me a bit, as between 15-30% of the world's population can cause around 2/3 of the problem and let the others deal with it. This is a great injustice that has been committed by the developed world. At the same time it kind of makes sense that such an action would occur, as profit and progress have been great motivators throughout history, driving people to commit horrible acts. I also find it somewhat consoling that Professor Hiltner apologized for the crisis as, many of us in the generation currently coming of age had almost nothing to do with the state of this world. Even later generations surely had nothing to do with it, yet have to live with it. I feel that the ignorance that we currently face regarding climate change can be boiled down to the fact that many people who deny Climate Change are partially insulated by the true effects, as they live on the rich end of rich developed countries. They have the means to ignore it, not every one does.  The key is now we have the power to change this, and it is our generation that will inevitably have to deal with this, and what we end up doing is very important.

Your comment was exactly what I wanted to comment. I agree that the comparison of the climate crisis being like that cigarette smoking scenario was really well thought out and highlighted that it only takes a small amount of participation to create years and years of struggle for the generations to come. I also agree with your point that as Americans we have so much privilege that allows us to ignore issues like climate change. But I would also like to add that not only is this true, but we also have a tendency to point fingers at other countries and find ways to blame them for things like their large population sizes and their uses of fossil fuels even though they have no other options. Although they might have very large populations, they still manage to contribute less CO2 emissions compared to the U.S. and just want to have the same opportunities (using fossil fuels) that the U.S. has had for the past 150ish years to go from developing to "developed".  
    <br><br>
     The only thing that I would have to disagree with you on is that I did not find Professor Hiltner's apology consoling and actually found it to be even more saddening. I feel like the people who are conscious about their impacts on the environment are, are the same ones who blame themselves for it being an issue in the first place, which makes me upset. The individual should not be the one to blame, if there is a need to blame someone, it should first go to the large corporations and politicians in power who have permitted and ignored this issue for so long, and even today refuse to do anything about it despite the overwhelming amount of evidence and warnings we have been given through research.

<p>
I still find it so crazy and nearly unfathomable how quickly this situation has come around, with nearly 3/4 of carbon emissions produced since 1959. How unfathomable it is that this has all happened in our "highly-advanced" and "developed" world. It is just so cruel. Clearly, the saying "ignorance is bliss" holds a lot of meaning in the climate situation, as ignorance is a choice in this age of technology and the ignorant majorly contribute to this problem in return for their personal lavish comfort and ignorant bliss. Furthermore, one of the parts that I find most upsetting is how the countries and people that are responsible for creating this problem are the ones who will be least affected, while the poorest (those who contributed the least to this issue) will suffer the most. 
<br><br>
I really don't know what else to say except that the time is now to act. What has happened has happened, and I don't personally hold any hard feelings towards those who do not know what they have done and contributed to this problem. However, now we know, and now I know about this issue - and the real crime would be to not act now for us who know what is going on. I am convinced we can win this fight and live in harmony with the earth and universe, but a very fundamental change must happen in how we treat ourselves and one another first.

I find it very interesting how you mentioned the saying "ignorance is bliss" in relation to the climate crisis. As Ken said in the video lecture, the wealth that our fossil economy has given us will help protect us from the dangers of climate change, but those who hardly contributed to the issue will suffer greater consequences. To me, it seems as though there is truly no justice in this system, due to the fact those who caused this problem don't really have to face it. While I agree that I don't personally have any resentment towards the generation who caused this problem, we must do our best to make them aware of the damage they have caused. It is important to start now so that the issue doesn't worsen.
<br><br>
Although there are many in the younger generation who are aware of the issue of climate change and seek to fix it, as Ken stated in the video, a lot of people in this generation still continue to make the same mistakes as those in the generation before us, simply because we were raised that way. While I am certain that our generation can successfully fight against climate change, it will definitely be harder for us to fix the mistakes of the past generation. I totally agree that we can win this fight and make peace with the earth which we have made nearly uninhabitable. It starts with being more aware of our actions and bringing awareness to the issue in any way possible. I am looking forward to future lectures where we can start discussing possibilities for amending this situation.

It’s very sad to see that climate changes have changed too quickly since 1959. From 315ppm to 415ppm, CO2 has risen almost 100 points only in a few decades. Industrial revolution happened in a lot of places after they got their independence. We humans made a great progress in technology during these decades, but we also lost a more important thing—a healthy homeland. We caused global warming and this is quite a climate crisis not only for old generations but also future generations. Future generations might suffer a lot from what we have caused for the environment. Maybe they can not drink clean water and breathe clean air or they might flee to different places just for hiding from natural disasters. From figure in the videos, we can see that most of greenhouse gas before was caused by developed countries like U.S. and U.K. People in poor countries tend to be more affected by climate changes. They do not have enough money to build a house or filter water, so they tend to be more invulnerable when facing climate changes. In my opinion, these developed countries should be responsible for what they have caused for earth. Also for those developing countries, they should learn more from these problems caused by developed countries. All of these countries should come up more methods for reducing greenhouse gases. Once they attend the conference for climate, they must keep their promises. United Nations also need to supervise all countries all the time.

Professor Hiltner put it best in the first lecture video “The climate crisis as a general issue” the younger generation is really pissed. To be blunt we have been passed down a planet that has not been cared for and is in utter crisis. As a generation z myself I can say with pride that I believe we have pushed for necessary change where prior generations have failed to do so. With Greta Thunberg and The Sunrise Movement as prime examples. As I do hope there is still time for us to make radical change in order to make the improvements we need it is such a disgrace that there was little to no help from the generations before us. This crisis was brought on in a single lifetime. This has been proven by the fact that CO2 levels have risen by 100 points in just 60 years. On top of this, knowing how much the United States is responsible for this but has been the least concerned is simply despicable.
<br><br>
This is eye opening, in our generation CO2 ppm has raised throughout our childhoods into us becoming adults all while climate change was ignored or put on the back burner for other minuscule issues. Now, it is left for us to pick up the mess from those before us. Although this is unfair I believe we were born just in time to save our planet. We might have a responsibility we do not want but one we must take on. It is crucial to create an environmentally and socially just planet before it is too late.

<p>
The lecture "The climate crisis as a generational issue" shows how their are members of the younger generation who have begun to protest for something to be done about climate change because it has been something that has been progressing in a negative way for a while now and not a lot has been done to prevent it and now we have to act soon and in an effective way. The younger generation is angry because this climate change problem did not just occur in this generation but the generation before and it has continued to worsen with time. Since many of the generation before us have ignored this problem, many of this generation have chosen to ignore it too. In the lecture "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime", the climate change is described as something that has not been building up for a very long time. It has been building up for about one lifetime and that is not a very long amount of time. This shows how little time it takes to negatively impact our planet and how little time it would take to continue to harm our planet and make it uninhabitable. In the video I liked the analogy to cigarette smoking because I felt that it accurately depicted the problem we are facing now. We are doing all of this harm to the planet and in doing so we are making it uninhabitable for future generations. We have been doing so for a while and it is as if we do not fear the consequences. I felt that Ken's apology was very sincere, especially since he is playing his part in preventing it. I knew that climate change was an issue before, but I never knew how urgent it was before taking ENGL 22. Like others, I believed that it wasn't a problem I would have to worry about for a long time. Like Al Gore, Ken is bringing the climate change problem to our attention and informing us on what we can do to prevent it. The problem is that the amount of people who know that climate change is a problem has not been enough to prevent it because we simply do not have the authority or power to do so. The government continues to ignore the problem and it makes people feel very hopeless because if they wanted to, they could slow down this process. Another problem is since we have waited so long to do something about this problem, our only solution is going to be a drastic one.

The film, “Before the Flood,” was very well done and extremely intriguing. I think that having Leonardo Dicaprio as the star of the movie was a very tasteful decision to bring in a vast array of audiences. Him being an attractive, successful academy award winning actor while also being a recognized climate activist made this a potentially successful film right off the bat. I really enjoyed that they incorporated not only the success that he has received in the activist community but also the backlash he got. It showed that he was so confident in his findings that he was comfortable being vulnerable with the world and showing his failure. 
<br><br> 
It was very engaging to be able to see physical visuals of the current effects of climate change. When he went to the Arctic and they showed a hose that used to be underground that has now been melted out in less than five years was mesmerizing in a negative manner. In the vast timeline of human existence five years is but a pinpoint. This fact goes to show the alarming rate that the climate is truly changing. To also see the streets of Miami flooding on a sunny day was a perfect example to show the oceans are truly rising. The floods there are not a result of rain but ocean water seeping up through the drains because the ice caps are melting causing the oceans to basically overflow.
<br><br>
 This film is very current and it is hard to imagine that some individuals still do not believe that this is a global crisis created by humans that can still be solved by humans.

The lecture video, “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” mentions how “the people who caused this problem (climate crisis) are still alive and still making it worse”. Ken’s generation caused this problem, according to him, and yet they are ignoring the facts and continuing to contribute C02 in the atmosphere. It makes me wonder what really matters in this world. I remember learning about how many people do not care for this physical world because they believe we are only here as a step to reach our real world with God. I think it is making many not care about our planet and may be a reason why they are still making it worse. I also found it interesting how the poorest 3 Billion people in the world contribute to only 5% of C02 in the atmosphere because there are Americans that claim those in developing countries are the ones that are contributing the most to the climate crisis, but they are wrong. Instead of pointing fingers at others, we need to focus on what we can do to better our country and planet as a whole. No one is innocent here. 
<br><br>
I appreciate Ken’s apology. It reiterates how no one is perfect, not even our generation. Although we did not grow up with tips on how to live sustainably, we know them now and must take action to bring an end to the climate crisis. We all abuse our planet (to different extents) and it is important take accountability and action because that will ultimately better our planet for future generations to enjoy. Ken mentions how he is unsure of what history will remember of his generation which made me wonder what history would think of mine. Here we are with the evidence that our planet is experiencing a climate crisis, but what are we doing about it? Are we hearing about our harmful effects on the planet and turning a blind eye? It is time to ask ourselves these type of questions and challenge ourselves to become more selfless and think about the bigger picture and care for our only home. His optimism is astounding. I am learning more and more about how my actions are harming the planet and am becoming eager to apply changes into my personal life for my sake and future generations to come.
</p><hr>

<p>
I left watching these videos feeling  a tad bit more pessimistic about not only the generation that came before me but also the generation that I am growing up with. As the lecture videos stated, in one generation alone CO2 in PPM has increased exponentially. Even if the generation before us has lead our current generation to abuse fossil fuels and our earth, it is up to our current generation to make change. I was severely hurt when Professor Hiltner brought up the statistic that stated that only three nations produced about 67% of the emissions that are currently in our air and oceans. I am personally filled with anger. For the poorest 3 million people on this planet to only create 5% of the total emissions on the planet... and for them to be severely punished for it... is simply absurd. 
<br><br>
It is essential that people of the old generation and new generation take action NOW and not later. Time and time again history has shown that the vast majority of people only take action when absolutely needed. The mindset of our generation needs to change to ensure the safety of our planet and the safety of future generations to come.
</p><hr>

<p>
It breaks my heart to say that I am deeply ashamed of many practices taking place in the United States today. We boast that we are the land of the free, yet what freedom will there be for future generations who are trapped by rising seas, raging fires, droughts, floods, diseases, and so much more. And what of the freedom of the other countries that we take advantage of? We place our factories in developing countries for their cheap labor and loose environmental laws, and plague their lands with a myriad of environmental problems that threaten their health. We are committing a crime to everyone else on earth as we emit the most pollution out of any other country, yet we will be the ones hidden away from the devastation because of the money this pollution has yielded us. It absolutely blows my mind that the generation before me did not act. They knew the science and they allowed themselves to be fed false information and decided to remain ignorant and selfish. Are we so self absorbed to think that we can destroy our planet in order to gain short term comfort and convenience? There are so many solutions out there and so many people that are actively trying to reverse what the generation above us has done, yet still today there are people who refuse to accept the science behind climate change. There are people who still advocate for rampant consumerism and infinite economic growth when these lifestyles are only doing unimaginable harm to our home. People need to wake up. People need to care. I think that it is so difficult getting people to believe in what they can not directly see. It is easy to cast doubt because of how slow these processes are happening and how far in the future the extreme damage will be seen. But this is science, hard facts. Already today we are seeing direct evidence of climate change occuring. The fires in California and Australia, the flooding in so many different parts of the world, the droughts happening in others. This is just the beginning. While it is inspiring that everyday more and more people wake up and take on this issue, more needs to be done. Radical change, while scary, is absolutely necessary. People think that leading a sustainable lifestyle will worsen their quality of life. They couldn’t be more wrong. Living sustainably means promoting life, promoting love, and promoting freedom.

“The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” disuse how the climate crisis rooted in human history and how it will continue to impact our environment today. The professor used an analogy of smoking cigarette with the suffering kids, our future will suffer the most even if they are not the initiator of the problem. CO2 is the most significant greenhouse gas, and along with methane and HFCs. However, CO2 continued to rise to 415 parts per million in just about 60 years. The CO2 will impact every living thing in the atmosphere. I am surprised by the data professor shown us in the video. I also feel sorry for the poor people because climate change will have a significant influence on the people who lack resources, even though the developing country has the most CO2 output. What’s worst is that in the next 20 years the date won’t go down. I am intrigued to learn how to solve the problem and apply that into my daily life. 
<br><br>
From Professor Hiltner’s narrative tone and expression, one can hear the shame he felt for his generation for didn’t act immediately when the issue first come up. Still, today we are all holding the responsibility to change the situation. If someone keeps smoking cigarettes, he will eventually die from various diseases. This is the same principle for harming the climate. It is sad to know the truth, but also knowing that we can contribute to stop the climate change, I feel a sense of hope for the future generation.

<p>
In the lecture, "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime," I was very surprised when you began to apologize about the actions that people in your generation have made and how ultimately they will affect us which is the next generation. I believe that slowly but surely with other people like yourself who teach young people about the climate crisis, more people will began to bring attention to the issue. Im just hoping it's not too late. There are still Many people from every generation that believe theses not a crisis and that we should not be giving it any attention. Unfortunately as a society we have began to grow and make greenhouse use and everyday necessity. I think it will be very difficult to completely cut down on all emissions but believe that it's important to start off with one thing at a time. Bring the attention to one thing and have everyone focus on that particular issue about the climate crisis. If everyone is focused on different issues,  it will be much harder to neutralize any of them. I really enjoyed the metaphor about the smoking cigarettes and the use of "The butterfly effect." A main issue nowadays is that people don't focus much about the future and are too selfish to even try to change their harming ways. Many people will continue to do so and won't realize it until it's too late. WE NEED TO SAVE OUR PLANET

In the lecture video “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” Ken explores the idea of how everything we are suffering from in the present is not something that had been occurring for millions of years before us, but rather only started 400 years ago. In such a short period, we have increased the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere from 280 ppm to 415 ppm. Ken apologizes on behalf of his generation about the crisis they have delivered to us and the way they failed to handle the situation when it was more contained. However, as he pointed out, we cannot change our future if politicians are still supporting the fossil fuel industries. It is this greediness that blinds us from the real danger that is waiting for us in the near future—extinction. Luckily, the youth of our generation are rebelling and speaking out about the environmental issues of our time and the past generations. The youth of today will be responsible for the youth of tomorrow. We need to start acting now and stop doing nothing before we turn into the generation our parents once were. Let’s not make the same mistakes. History should be our guide for a brighter future.

After having watched Professor Hiltner's two lecture videos, where he talks about the climate crisis being caused by a single lifetime, I now understand the importance of fighting for our planet earth. I don't want to continue the mistakes of our past generations, especially living in the country that emits a quarter of the Co2 in our atmosphere alone. I found that fact quite depressing, and how alongside Europe and Russia we emit two thirds of the worlds Co2. Moreover, I especially liked how Professor Hiltner made the analogy of smoking cigarettes to the "fossil fuel addiction" as he put it. Overall, this weeks assignments to inform us about the climate crisis does put me down, but having taken English 22 in the fall, I know Professor Hiltner will also deliver assignments that make us hopeful for the future.

Both “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” are eye opening videos that provide a lot of meaningful information about how the human population has contributed to the climate crisis over the past years. Professor Ken talks about the changes he has seen occur over his lifetime and how drastic they were. Not only does he acknowledge the problem he also states that many of these same people who caused the problem are still alive and making things worse by living in denial that climate change exists. Ken mentions that today's generation is suffering from what previous generations have done to our planet. Previous generations lived in denial about climate change because the consequences of mistreating the planet were delayed by many years. A change in American’s lifestyles would make a small difference, if only people were willing to take action and cooperate things could be better for future generations. I mention a change in American’s lifestyles because of how much greenhouse gases we emit in comparison to other countries. We emitted 25% of the carbon dioxide since 1959 while 3 billion people in undeveloped countries only emitted 5%. While these undeveloped countries are contributing the least to the planets greenhouse gases, they are the ones who are suffering the most from the consequences that climate change has had on the planet. It is sad to see this reality as other people are suffering from our countries actions. Today's generation is trying its best to bring awareness by taking action to prevent future generations from suffering from even more drastic climate change consequences. Unfortunately it will take more than just today’s generation to make a positive change in our environment. However, I do believe that their activism is great start as it is bringing awareness to others who might be interested in being part of the movement.

If I am being completely honest, I never thought of climate change as a generational issue. As I watched both lecture videos, I thought looking at climate change through this angle was very interesting. While I do agree that climate change was fueled by my parents generation and definitely left us at the tipping point of an almost uninhabitable earth, that leaves no excuse for the current generation to just give up. The segments of youth activists protesting in the video are inspiring yet I think we contribute to the problems as well. Yes, we have a right to be as professor Hiltner puts it “pissed”, but we can’t solely blame the boomer generation if we continue to add to the problem by continuing to increase our carbon footprint or contributing to the companies that use fossil fuels and oils which pump ore CO2 into the atmosphere. It is frustrating what my generation has been left with and that we’re forced to come up with drastic solutions quickly. However, in the second video, the described “time delay” of the consequences of our parent’s generation should be a lesson to us all. If we continue to follow in their footsteps, we will experience another delay in the consequences that our generation is creating on top of the results that we are facing today. 
<br><br>
The second video provides more insight to associate the call to action that our generation needs to understand. The scenario with smoking cigarettes is an example of how our parents generation kept polluting the earth with no consequences without realizing that eventually, their kids would have to bear them. I like how this example is linked to the 2019 statistics of Russia, the US, and Europe’s contribution to climate change when they are in fact 1/8th of the entire global population where as the poor population which is comprised of three billion people contribute significantly less. This shows how we are still contributing to the problem and not learning from the mistakes of the past. The fate for the coming generation is completely in our hands. Acknowledging the statistics and the science presented is simply not enough and we seriously need to take steps to act on this crisis.

I agree that, although the baby boomer generation made a lot of mistakes with how much of the earth’s resources they used up and how much CO2 they dispelled into the air, they are not solely to blame for the events caused by climate change. I believe that many people in the boomer generation, if they were properly informed on all of the consequences of their actions (by the government and similar authorities), would have started similar “green” projects and groups to the ones that are being formed by my generation today. But, because the consumer mindset was instilled in the boomer generation, now they tend to stick to what things they were raised to believe. On the whole, older people prefer not to change their lifestyles or opinions whereas younger people can easily adapt to new situations and new ways of thinking. This is why we need to rely on this current generation to make the change to a greener planet. I also agree with the statement that my generation is part of the problem. We too are of a consumer mindset. Perhaps we prefer to consume items like phones, computers, ipads and similar technology, but it doesn’t make us any better than the boomer generation. What we do have on our side is the fact that we can be persuaded to change our current lifestyles and to move towards a greener future. Now, we need to harness this power and apply it to our daily routines of life as we know it.
<br><br>
I really dislike the fact that the poorer countries (less developed countries) will be hit the hardest by climate change events such as flooding and hurricanes. It's ironic and it’s also very unfair. It gives an excuse to all of the big wigs, running their corporations which are destroying the Earth, to just continue on with what they are doing because it doesn’t affect them. They are wealthy and they don’t have to depend on a farm that could be flooded at any time. No one can touch them because, in our society, money is power and, oftentimes, the greediest (aka the least selfless) people are often the ones with the most money and therefore the most power. Why would seeing the suffering of those “below them” even cause them to bat an eyelid? One thing that could take down these corrupted organizations is the power of the people. If we stand strong together, to fight for our Earth, nothing can stand in our way.
<br><br><hr><br>
I am 100% in your favor, I do believe that although we blame the Boomer generations for our current climate crisis, we are also to blame because we are yet to change out lifestyle to be more environmentally conscience. However, as the generation faced with the issue, will are forced to fight the corrupted government into adhering to our demands if we are to live on this planet. We have started that fight through the Youth movement in protesting and petitioning policies meant to improve our current situation. So I hope we continue forward to reach our goal of eliminating fossil fuel companies.
<br><br><hr><br>
In response to this comment, I agree that I had also never thought of climate change as a generational issue. Before, I always thought the beginning of this crisis coinciding with the Industrial Revolution. Natalia makes a valid point about how our generation is continuing to add to this global problem so we cannot just blame the boomer generation and give up. Being forced to make drastic changes is a tough situation to be in, especially if action is not taken. Out of those I am close with who are worried about the climate crisis, a majority of them do nothing to reduce their carbon footprint. Simply retweeting a post about the coral reefs dying does not exactly do anything to fix our planet’s fate. Climate justice is also an issue that is often overlooked. Like the smoking metaphor used, the actions of developed countries, mainly the United States, is not currently severely affecting us, yer lesser developed areas are suffering. I agree with Natalia that the livelihood of future generations is in our hands and we need to do more than those older than us to stop this cycle.
<br><br><hr><br>
I think this is an important point. In one respect, climate change is certainly a generation issue, whether we like it or not, because generations will experience very different benefits and consequences of the lifestyle that led to the crisis we face now. It's also a generational issue because the generations that will be affected most heavily by the climate crisis will not have the same power to reverse it that the generation now in power does. Think about Greta Thunberg, or others like her, with strong voices and ability to create change now, and the desperate need to do so. Greta would not be able to run for president in the U.S. (assuming she met the other requirements to do so) for another 20 years, 20 years where current leaders can continue to cause irreversible damage to our planet. Most college students don't have the means to affect the policy of governments of fossil fuel companies except by mass action, so it means something to me personally when Professor Hiltner apologizes on behalf of his generation. It's a bit biblical, but powerful.
<br><br>
but your reminder is really necessary - Greta can warn the leaders of the world that we will not forgive them for inaction now, but in the same way, if we do not act, we will carry the same burden and blame. Professor Hiltner's introduction to environmental justice on 1/10/20 and in this video is compelling. If, with the knowledge of the consequences of our actions, we don't take responsibility for those consequences, I believe we bear far more blame for the sin of environmental destruction.

It has never crossed my mind that climate change is a generational issue, that it was caused and exacerbated by a single generation of humanity on Earth. After watching the lecture video “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, I realized that to many and to my own surprise, climate change is indeed a generational issue as fossil fuels were discovered in the generation that is now reaching the age of our parents, and this generation had ruthlessly exploited our environment and natural resources with the burning of fossil fuels to produce commercial products and to generate huge economic revenues without considering the severe negative consequences of their such actions on our environment. 
<br><br>
With a vivid example of smoking and tobacco use, professor Hiltner explains in the video that the generational nature of smoking tobacco will expose all of the future generations of not only the ones who smoke but also others who do not smoke, or essentially all people on Earth, to extremely high risks of diseases related to tobacco use, including lung cancer, heart disease, and more. Similarly, being another significant generation issue, climate change would render all future generations of human beings subject to the negative impacts of climate change. In a sense, the generation who initiated the process of climate change had left their children and future generations of descendants of a planet that is gradually becoming inhabitable. 
<br><br>
Additionally, professor Hiltner has pointed it out in the video that the U.S. alone supplied roughly a quarter of the carbon dioxide emission into the atmosphere. Combined with other countries in Europe, these developed countries, even though they only occupied approximately one-eighth of the world population, had contributed a majority or two-thirds of the carbon dioxide emission into the air. In comparison, the poorest three billion people in the world, despite that they occupied a majority of the world population, only contributed to about five percent of the carbon dioxide emission, which is rather insignificant. 
<br><br>
This distinct contrast forming the inverse relationship between the population and the amount of carbon dioxide emission had compelled me to think over the forthcoming impacts of climate change in the world specifically in developed and non-developed countries. It then occurred to me that people living in non-developed countries would definitely have to face the worse and tougher challenges and impacts of climate change due to their weak economic power and national stability that the developed countries had gained from their expanding economies stimulated by fossil fuels. 
<br><br>
This is an unfortunate yet inescapable truth because of the unfair power struggles and structures of the world. I can only strive to stay optimistic about the future hoping for the best outcomes and the awakening of humanity to really see climate change as a real and urgent issue while doing all I can to help raise awareness on climate change and contributing my efforts to save our planet.

I really appreciated your comment response to this video. Your first sentence immediately grabbed my attention as I had the same exact thought. As strange as it is, I never thought to approach the climate crisis as a generational issue. What was a great clarification that professor Hiltner does a great job of explaining and putting into words, is his depiction of the issue of time delay. I similarly made the connection back to my parents and grandparents- but even more so, with professor Hiltner’s personal connection to climate crisis, as it is literally within his lifetime that this climate crisis rose to severity.
<br><br>
This time delay that he talks about was a very clear picture to me after he said it. I immediately made the connection and understood how and why didn’t people just stop or improve upon the climate issues early on. This literally applies with all situations, but when consequences aren’t immediately seen, we choose to ignore it. We think it’s okay. We drive a car out, we don’t think about it too much. But the CO2 is constantly accumulating and we don’t see the effects before our eyes, which causes us to not take any immediate action. To apply this to recent news, a case of a patient who was very sick from juuling. She shared her experience on her social media, and soon it spread around like wildfire. I see so many people juuling everywhere in college, and this is exactly a case. They don’t see the immediate consequences, so they continue. The case is completely different if they see the consequence right before them. For example, if you accidentally cut yourself and you see you’re bleeding and it hurts- you take action. You get a bandaid, you clean up, you be more careful with knives.
<br><br>
Similar to you, I also had a lasting impression on the statistics provided by professor Hiltner. The fact that the developed world has contributed so much CO2, yet make up so little of the population...it makes us seem so privileged. Yet, the rest of the world that makes up almost all of the population are contributing so little. Due to their lack of wealth and development, they don’t have many of the things we do to keep ourselves safer or in a better position so as we can feel the impact less (such as things like air conditioning, house insulation, water purifiers, etc.). As a part of the American society, I’ve always been aware that we are up there in polluting. I still remember when Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement, how alarmed I was and what kind of unfortunate things we would end up following through. Like you, I also strive to stay optimistic and do what bits I can (it all counts after all in my eyes) to push for awareness on the climate crisis issues we face during our youth movements being pushed through today. I hope for a healthy planet for my future generations.

“The climate crisis as a generational issue” as well as this video were really interesting as they brought the way I see the climate crisis into a new light. To realize that the majority of the pollution and contamination that caused the climate crisis have only been put into the air in one lifetime is absolutely mind-boggling. Learning that the cause and effect of the climate crisis isn’t as immediate as people would anticipate is interesting, yet worrying, as it makes me wonder what is yet to come. 
<br><br>
I appreciated that the unjust nature of the climate crisis was addressed. The fact that of ⅛ of the world creating such a massive issue for the ⅞ of the world who barely contributed to the issue is absurd and I think will be a major reality check to many people- it definitely was for me. As we saw in “Before the Flood,” most of the consequences of the climate crisis are hitting the poorer, underdeveloped areas of the world first- people that have no access to electricity, heat, gas, cars, etc. to nearly the degree that we do. Many of them farm for sustenance, and the abnormal weather, flooding and extreme heat that the climate crisis brings is ruining their chances of survival and success.  It’s completely unjust, and I’m eager to learn about more ways to combat this issue.

I completely agree in that this video shines a different light on the climate crisis. Firstly, the hard facts that supported Ken’s claim made the video informational and undeniable. But I thought an even more impactful aspect of this video was how emotionally appealing it was. Hearing about how fast the climate crisis came upon earth was alarming, and quite frankly not something I had considered prior to watching this video. His points about hoping that his generation would join our own in being more conscious of the environment made me question the decisions my family makes. I choose to be vegetarian for the sake of the environment, but I grew up eating meat as protein every day. I know that my parents care about the state of the planet, but I can’t remember them ever making sacrifices so that their worry could be put to action. This video has inspired me to bring that message home, and to others in the generations above and below me.
<br><br><hr><br>
I also think it is unbelievable that most of the climate change has only occurred within a single lifetime. In addition, it is also unbelievable that most of this change was only caused by 1/8 of the entire world population. Taking into consideration the disproportionality of the time which it took for climate change to drastically occur and also the small amount of people who are accounting for most of the climate crisis, we are able to see how unfair this issue is on multiple dimensions. I think the professor does a good job in making that clear, even starting off in "The Climate Change as a Generational Issue," noting the generational gap in which climate change is addressed, which he mentioned all occurred within a single lifetime. 
<br><br>
Adding on to seeing the climate crisis in a new light through the lectures, I think we are able to see this because the professor shows us the climate crisis through a different lens, or as how he states, how we allowed this to happen. Unlike other climate change sources, the mechanics of climate change itself is not  mentioned, but what led up to it. I think this is very important, because I feel like many people do know that climate change is a big issue. However, through these lectures, we are able to see the inequality and unfairness of climate change itself, which I think was very important.
<br><br>
The analogy of the cigarettes is also important because it helps contribute to the unfairness of climate change. As mentioned, only 1/8 of the entire population of Earth is mostly responsible for climate change. I like that the professor emphasizes that the rich and developed countries are those who are mostly taking part in climate change. It is unbelievable that the United States is responsible for 1/4 of carbon dioxide put in the atmosphere even though they only make up 4% of the worlds population, where as the worlds poorest 3 billion people are responsible for 5% of carbon dioxide in the world's atmosphere. Again, this emphasizes the disproportionality of the climate crisis, as 1/8 of the entire world population is responsible for 66% of the worlds pollution, reiterating that those who are not even responsible for climate change will be affected. In addition, the professor makes a valid point, stating that though those in poorer countries are not responsible for a large percentage of climate change, they will nonetheless suffer the consequences more than those in a rich country. 
<br><br>
I like that the professor ends the lecture by acknowledging that the way the climate crisis is today is because of past generations.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree with everything you said in your comment. It truly is mind-blowing to find out that the majority of the damage that has been done to the Earth is not something accumulated over centuries of human activity, but rather one lifetime. The older generation has ruined the environment with their greed for human advancement, and as a result, future generations would have to deal with the mess they have made. We could chalk it to them being uninformed, however even with details about the climate crisis surfacing every day, instead of stopping, many refuse to believe in climate change and continue to neglect the environment. We, the younger generation, must do something to stop climate change, however, and although there are steps that we are taking to reduce the amount of CO2 emitted, the majority of our generation too live lifestyles where tons of CO2 is produced, thus endangering future generations even more.
<br><br>
It truly is unjust with how climate change affects underdeveloped countries more than us. The developed countries like the United States, Russia, and Europe only count to 1/8 of the world's population but is responsible for nearly 2/3 of the carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere, while the poorest 3 billion only contribute to 5% of CO2 production. Like you said, in the documentary "Before the Flood" we saw that climate change affects the poor, underdeveloped countries, those without the power to combat it. The fact that they are suffering for something that they have contributed very little to is unjust, and like you, I am eager to find ways to help with this issue.

Ken’s second lecture video, “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” does a great job of explaining the topic brought up in his first video, “The climate crisis as a generational issue,” as in it he speaks on how the delayed effects of climate change have created generational divide on the issue. For example, in the second lecture video Ken talks about how global CO2 levels have risen 100 points since 1959, from 315 ppm to 415 ppm. During the 60 years of this massive rise in CO2 levels, a whole generation has grown up relying on the abuse of fossil fuels without yet feeling many of the consequences of their actions. 
<br><br>
Now, as time has passed and the younger generation begins to enter the world, we are faced with the most devastating and imminent effects of global warming despite causing little harm to the planet compared to early generations. The generations who already  abused our planet continue to age and pass away, meaning that despite their behavior they will likely not live long enough to feel many of the consequences due to the delayed effects of global warming. I believe that this is where the generational divide on the climate crisis is most clear, as the younger generation feels that they are going to feel all of the negative effects of climate change, while those who largely caused the issue, the aging older generations, will begin to pass away without ever being forced to pay for or correct their destructive actions.

The lecture "how the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" indeed astonishes me as it reminds me of a fact I've never been able to realize before: what we do today might not impact people around us today, but it will surely make the subsequent generations suffer a lot. It makes me feel guilty and ashamed especially when I think about what I do in my daily life that contributes to greenhouse gas emission will have a huge impact on subsequent generations. Another lesson I learned is the injustice involved in the climate change issue. I feel bad for those people living in poor countries because they did almost nothing to harm the environment but they have to share the suffering with people who actually contribute to greenhouse gas emission much more than they do. The fact just makes me deem myself selfish and It more inspires me to take action to protect the earth and save the earth.

The video “How climate crisis brought about in a single lifetime” was shocking. Personally, for me, the most shocking part was when Ken mentioned that a quarter of all the CO2 put in the atmosphere was from the united states. This is frustrating being my country, while I had realized that it was mainly caused by humans, the fact that a quarter was America is mind-blowing. While the poorest percentage of people in the world contributed only 5%. With this information out for the public, it amazes me that these big countries like the united states, Russia, and China, have not done more to help save the planet. Because of the impact of these countries, everyone in the world is suffering. The video “The climate crisis as a generational issue” was the first piece in this class to give me hope. While yes it is unfair and frustrating how past generation has left the earth in this condition to us, the fact that people my age are educating themselves, and fighting and demanding for a change is inspiring. The more people are educated the better chance we have for a change while it is not too late.

It is sad to think the poorest people only contribute 5% of the global co2 emissions, but will likely be the most impacted by the climate crisis. It is nice to see a glimmer of hope through all the devastating effects that have been brought to our attention. I agree that the previous generations have left the future in not too great of hands, but now people are educating themselves and demanding change is uplifting to hear. It is scary, however, that we continue to increase c02 emissions drastically even with all of the evidence of c02s effects on the climate.

<p>
Both of my parents were born in the same generation as Ken (1958 and 1959) and I can say that I was raised to be environmentally unconscious. Besides recycling (mainly for family profit), I was never exposed to the concept of climate change and its severity until around the middle of high school and also never had a firm understanding of it until taking English 22. I don't blame my parents for my massive carbon footprint because they  were raised by my grandparents who were just as clueless. As Ken admitted, I do believe the progression of climate change today is the fault of his generation, but it is frustrating to see individuals of the same generation who choose to remain ignorant towards the fate of this planet. I believe politicians who do not believe in climate change are less informed than the youth of today on the subject for selfish reasons. If they listened to more of what we have to say and acknowledge that this may not be THEIR biggest issue of today, it is definitely ours-the younger generations following baby boomers. It's frightening knowing that we are in the stage where the idea of having children is a risk on their well-being. More "anti-climate change" politicians need to understand this and make immediate changes in federal policies toward oil-industries.

I think that your point on how your parents were raised to be "environmentally-unconscious" is extremely important in the conversation of who is to blame for the climate crisis we currently face. The harmful effects of mass fossil fuel extraction and consumption were not understood until well after their introduction to the masses occurred, much like how the effects of cigarettes weren't expressed until decades after their production and popularity boom. However, I huge part of this environmental unconsciousness is due to the hiding of the facts by the huge corporations profiting off of fossil fuels. I simply can't blame an entire generation for the actions of a very select few. While this mass deception may have been the case in the beginning of this previous generation, there has been too much information on climate change and environmental destruction in the past few decades for people to still be ignorant. What really shocks me is how so many people understand and acknowledge what is happening to our planet, but still refuse to lift a finger to make a difference. Now more than ever, it is so easy to help the cause via donation, voting, activism. Simply reposting an environmental awareness video on Facebook counts as something, but a majority of people won't activate in the slightest. I feel that in the next election, the environmental perspective of each candidate will play a very important role, at least for the democrat candidates.

It is upsetting that there has been such a fast increase in our carbon footprint due to the last generations ignorance. I wish they thought about the consequences of their actions before ruining our beautiful atmosphere for monetary profits. It is also sad that, as a country, the United States has contributed the most to the carbon emissions in our world’s atmosphere. I feel as though America has a big influence in the world and in order to enact change, the United State’s priorities need to lie more with protecting our planet in order to set an example. I am very excited to participate in my first election because a candidate that is passionate about the climate crisis is a necessary quality in a candidate for me. 
<br><br>
I found the cigarette smoking example interesting because it really illustrates the divide between the last generations issue with the climate crisis to today's generation. The time delay for the negative effects of immense co2 emissions to form is what drove the last generations bad behavior. They didn't see the bad outcomes of their actions and left it to the new generation, which is why it's a pressing issue today but wasn't necessarily a large issue before. I just hope that today’s generation will be able to make a difference and truly limit our carbon footprint in order to save the increasing temperatures of our planet.

After watching "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" I completely agree with your analysis. For some reason people living today can't see past all the money they're making and focus on the consequences that their children, grandchildren, etc will be forced to deal with in the future. It's selfish and ignorant how most Americans can't make even the slightest changes like switching to a plant based diet to reduce greenhouse gas emissions(ex. CO2 and methane). I feel like we should be held responsible for our actions especially taking into account like you mentioned and the video stated that the U.S. is only 1/8 of the global population, but produces the most CO2. If we can't even make these changes for our future families, then it seems highly unlikely anything is going to change for developing countries and the animals on this planet. At the end of your comment you take about our generation choosing. to make a difference and I think one of the biggest steps in the right direction is to make sure everyone votes. We need leaders and lawmakers that understand the gravity of this situation, as we are gaining the information in Climate Crisis 101.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree with your comment in that I also find it quite bizarre that a quarter was CO2 was put onto this world by the United States. That number is simply incomprehensible, but it is also true, and the United States really need to set its priorities straight and take responsibility for cleaning up the mess it created. Because as Ken mentions in the video, it's simply unethical that the United States is generating unprecedented wealth by ruining our planet, but that wealth will eventually shield them from their own mess while the rest of the world suffers.
<br><br>
I really like that you mention participating in your first election, because given how pissed the younger generation are at what has been done to our planet by the previous generation and the number of leaders that still consider the climate crisis a hoax (Trump abandoned the Paris Agreement), it is crucial for the youths to use their own power, specifically their voting rights, to put people who care in positions of power.
<br><br><hr><br>
I completely agree with you on how tragic the destruction of our Earth has been, especially considering it has mainly occurred within the past 50 years.  Like Professor Hiltner said in “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, I know it was not the fault of our generation, but it is now our fight, a fight that shapes the future of our children, grandchildren, and all the species on the earth as we know it.  Not only is the science behind finding sustainable ways to live on the earth important, but also the spread of awareness on the issue at hand, which is why it is such a blessing to have classes such as this one.
<br><br>
Something that also stood out to me was the role that the United States has played in the exponential increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  It is disgusting to think that though developed countries are mainly causing this issue, developing countries are going to feel the most effects.  People will be punished despite not being a part of the problem.  How scary would that be, if the amount of carbon dioxide increased to above 415 ppm? Like you said, the United States needs to set a precedence and show the world that reducing emissions can be done, to save both the planet and ourselves.

I agree with your comment in that I also find it quite bizarre that a quarter was CO2 was put onto this world by the United States. That number is simply incomprehensible, but it is also true, and the United States really need to set its priorities straight and take responsibility for cleaning up the mess it created. Because as Ken mentions in the video, it's simply unethical that the United States is generating unprecedented wealth by ruining our planet, but that wealth will eventually shield them from their own mess while the rest of the world suffers.
<br><br>
I really like that you mention participating in your first election, because given how pissed the younger generation are at what has been done to our planet by the previous generation and the number of leaders that still consider the climate crisis a hoax (Trump abandoned the Paris Agreement), it is crucial for the youths to use their own power, specifically their voting rights, to put people who care in positions of power.

I completely agree with you on how tragic the destruction of our Earth has been, especially considering it has mainly occurred within the past 50 years.  Like Professor Hiltner said in “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, I know it was not the fault of our generation, but it is now our fight, a fight that shapes the future of our children, grandchildren, and all the species on the earth as we know it.  Not only is the science behind finding sustainable ways to live on the earth important, but also the spread of awareness on the issue at hand, which is why it is such a blessing to have classes such as this one.

After watching “climate crisis as a generational issue,” I realize there is a big disconnect on the issue of climate change between younger and older generations. It is important today's youth steps up to try and correct this disconnect between the different generations in order to make real change happen. 
<br><br>
After watching “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” my eyes were really opened to why climate change is not really taken seriously by a lot of people. The effects are hard to see and generally the things we do today will mainly affect future generations long after we’ve passed. Ken’s analogy with the cigarette smoking was a great help in trying to wrap my mind around this phenomenon. The injustice that those who contribute to the climate crisis the least face the brunt of the negative consequences of climate change is really sad to see. Economic factors have a huge affect on whether someone can deal with climate change-related disasters or effects. Wealthy people can migrate and move to other places while the poor don’t really much of a choice but to stay.

It is so sad to see that the wealthy who are actually capable of making a change during this climate crisis, are the ones who make the problem worst. What's worst is that the wealthy will not suffer the consequences but the poor will. The poor will suffer the most since they will not manage to survive. I think that this is so unfair. Even though the poor maybe be the only ones to accept the problem and want to do something about it, that is not enough. we all have to have to solve this problem together whether we are wealthy or poor. The wealthy may have a lot of different money obligations but it would be grateful if they had a more right-minded obligation to approach what really matters.I also think that apart from thinking about finding a solution, the wealthy should think about the poor and help them prepare for losses of things like land and money. this could be very costly for them but in the end it is worth what they usually pay for which are things that caused thus climate crisis to begin with.

In the lecture "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime", professor Ken proposed a few solutions to the climate crisis. Time delay in the consequences of environmentally destructive behaviors played a major role in the climate crisis.
<br><br>
I was shocked to learn that what a small group of people do can have a huge impact on the rest of the world and that the impact of what they do will start to show up in years and will last longer.

In the first lecture, I instantly connected to the topic as  I have heard of the generational split on climate change on countless articles online and in person due to conversations. I found his opinion of how the children are now coming to age ready to fight for their future is very on point. The young generation is living in a world burdened by the actions of past generations, and sadly in the future the young generation is going to be the only ones answering for them. I have personally seen how young people have risen up and demanded action to be taken place. I agree with the lecture in the way Ken describes how he is not surprised that the young generation is pissed. A youth generational ruse is necessary to fix the problems created by past generations. I then listened to the lecture, “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”. I really enjoyed the  representation he used that portrayed the time delay between action and the effect. I believe that past generations struggled with the idea that current actions may not immediately have an impact, but down the line can be catastrophic. I think the analogy with the cigarette pack was super good. I wish older generations could watch that part, as I do not believe most people have the understanding of the impactions of their actions. It was a severe analogy, but necessary for a severe situation. It is very sad to see people still indulging on the “cigarettes” even knowing the effects down the line as he highlighted in his analogy. The co2 rise is very alarming, and it is crazy that 3.4 of co2 has been put out in the past lifetime. That is an absurd that amount of co2 was allowed to be released, especially as it was mostly from america. I hope his analysis of how much co2 can be continued to be released does not end up happening. This lecture was very informative. It changed the way I viewed the timeline of co2 emissions. I initially thought it was a long timeline, however it is truly a lifetime crisis.

I agree with your wonderful insight on this topic.  I believe we also need to keep in mind when we talk about "our generation" we separate ourselves into two groups: Those who have benefited from the "fossil fuel society", and those who have not.  I can only imagine being in the shoes of a 19 year old in the Philippines whose house was just flooded due to unnatural sea level rises, and being infuriated by seeing the waste and luxury WE in America live in.  This leads me to a question: "Do people in the developing world deserve the chance to benefit from the "fossil fuel society", or should we, in global solidarity, all work towards reducing out carbon footprint?  I think this is a challenging question because it does not matter where the pollution is coming from, it will still damage the world, but people in developing nations will feel duped out of having access to cheap energy that will greatly improve their quality of living.  I think an uninspired answer is both.  We should allow developing nations to still use cheap energy, while also developing solutions to move towards clean power.
<br><br>
I was also intrigued by the cigarette analogy.  I think it paints a fair picture of what is going on, and why what developed nations are currently doing to the climate is an absolute shame.  We must switch to clean energy and find ways to save the planet, even if that mean radically changing how we live our lives.

This video as well as “The climate crisis as a generational issue” are very interesting to me because it is crazy to imagine that such a large impact on our world’s climate was done in only a 60 year timespan. The fact that ¾ of all the CO2 affecting the climate crisis was released in the last 60 years is appalling, and our nation is one of the largest contributors to this problem. It is not fair that we justify our use of fossil fuels and continue to destroy Earth’s atmosphere for all inhabitants of Earth. As stated in this video, the citizens in developed nations will not feel the effects as severely as those in poorer areas, but how is it fair that they only produced 5% of the CO2 and they are going to be the people who are punished the most. We as citizens in the richer nations should use our status to try to turn this situation around and use our wealth to fund research and programs to help fight against climate change instead of using our resources to keep burning fossil fuels and making our situation worse.
<br><br>
If only ⅛ of the population could negatively affect our climate this much for hundreds of generations, imagine how much could be done if the vast majority of Earth’s population came together to try and combat global warming. We need to start becoming more self aware and making others aware of this crisis and solutions to this problem because, as stated in this video, the newer generations were taught to be as careless as the previous ones and that is probably why humans keep unknowingly contributing to this problem. I know that growing up, I would occasionally hear about global warming and every time I heard those words they were followed by “it’s not true” or “it’s a lie” and I continued on about my day unaware that I was becoming a part of the pollution problem. Now it is up to our generation to enlighten others about the consequences of this pollution because we are essentially Earth’s last hope for trying to save the planet. We have to try to right the wrongs of our previous generations in order to maintain a world where we can have children and they don’t have to worry about severe floods, droughts, and sea level rise. Professor Ken does a great way of opening our eyes to this fact when we used the example of cigarettes and showed how the first generation was not affected but all of the generations that proceeded suffered because of choices that were not even ours.

Hiltner’s “the climate crisis as a generational issue” highlights the younger generations’ participation in the battle against this ironic climate crisis, in which we’ve been handed a planet in much more danger than some think, where a copious contribution was man-made and by the U.S. alone. At least I am relieved to know that there are a significant amount of people in the movement who share the same values and beliefs in making a change for the greater good of this beautiful planet as well as the ticking-time-bomb future of the generations to come. It’s mind-blowing how desensitized some of the later generations have become to hard evidence, so much so that the mere proof of their substantial contributions to the climate crisis in comparison to poverty-rich countries still manages to turn a blind eye. For these selfish denialists, they are able to sleep at night knowing they won’t be around long enough to see the extreme consequences of their actions. However, as long as education on the crisis remains dense in hard factual evidence and descriptive in proactive measures, I strongly believe that, collectively, we have the power to correct our mistakes and provide a healthy future for our grandchildren’s grandchildren.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching the lecture videos where Professor Hiltner blamed his generation for the unwelcoming earth left to our generation  I was better informed on how the climate crisis was able to reach this point. However, I believe that our generation is also accountable for what's occurring now too because we abuse fossil fuels and other finite resources damaging our environment while there is clear evidence of the damage being caused now. While our parents did raise us with these lifestyles it's up to us to break the pattern that's been leading to the demise of our home. But rather point fingers its more important that we work to reach a solution and collectively make environmentally conscious decisions so we can try to leave the earth a better place than when we found it. 
<br><br>
Additionally, after reading the article I was shocked by the percentage of CO2 we are responsible for as a country. Even more surprising is that 3 billion people only account for 5% of the CO2 being emitted and to think what if they produced emissions like us. Since the USA is an example for many of those countries with the 3 billion people it would be terrible if every one of those individuals began polluting like the average American. This is why I feel all generations and classes should work together to strive for more environmentally friendly practices since we set an example and want everyone else to strive for renewability and significantly cut emissions too.

<p>
In the lecture “climate crisis as a generational issue”, the professor introduces how youth movements are making efforts to fight against climate change. They are also unsatisfied that people always negotiate the issue rather than solve it when there’re still chances, being angry and frustrated about the damaged environment where the damage is still proceeding. But because many of the previous generations denied global warming, many of this generation still choose to deny the serious issue as well. 
<br><br>
In the lecture “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” Ken stresses that global warming is an issue that happens in a lifetime and also tries to calm anxiety by stating that we still have chances to change and protest global warming. Since the effects are always trivial and our actions we take will also affect our future generations, we have to take our time and work on the problems so as to provide our offerings a better life.

"The climate crisis as a generational issue" expanded my view on the cause of the current epidemic of climate change that we are now going through. While I have definitely heard that the cause of the CO2 emissions have risen due to a generation, it has never come across my mind on how impactful the generation's CO2 emissions have affected our planet. The fact that CO2 has risen 100 PPM in a matter of 60 years is mind blowing. Has it never occurred to the older generation that they are not only affecting the planet but also the lives of their children, grandchildren, and many more. Ken's analogy of smoking summed up the crisis that is at hand effectively. Someone who smokes, but with no bad effects to them, but only on their children perfectly explains the situation that the generation has left us. Ken believes that we can still fix this issue, and I believe we can too. With greedy CEOs and politicians that are in denial of climate change, it'll be difficult, but it won't be impossible.

 I also felt the same once I heard Ken talking about the outstanding rise in emissions in his lifetime, a rate that is three times faster than in preceding centuries. While it is an injustice to us younger generations that are now going to have to suffer the consequences, we can not victimize ourselves as we have seldom learned to change our habits from those who are older. While younger people are more consciously aware of the issue, there is still little being done as the immediate affects still haven't completely hit us. The real injustice lies within the fact that us as a developing nation still refuse to take charge while undeveloped nations are going to have to suffer the bulk of what we have caused. We are collectively to blame, despite us being younger. The fact that the United States, Europe, and Russia have contributed to nearly 2/3 of all the CO2 emissions while only being 1/8 of the world's total population is not only shocking, but shameful. Our lack of consideration for the rest of the world., specifically the poor, contradicts basic fundaments of humankind. Where we should be helping each other, we are allowing the poorest 3 billion of the world, who virtually had nothing to do with the problem, suffer the most from our greedy actions.
<br><br><hr><br>
This week's reading was really dark in terms of the imagery that Wallace-Wells used to describe the sheer magnitude of the impacts of climate change so I'm pleasantly surprised at how optimistic you are about how we as a generation can resolve this grand, global issue. I certainly hope that impeding the worst case scenarios is possible with so many authoritative figures denying the existence of climate change. Regardless of how the older generation responded to increasing levels of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere, I believe our generation can and should take power away from influential climate change deniers through whatever means for our and our children's sake.

This  2nd lecture of Ken Hiltner really open my eyes to this problem. Its amazing how much carbon has been produced in Hiltner's life. It just goes to show how much we do not care about this world. This carbon will keep increasing because we are so dependent on fossil fuels in society. This will cause many challenges and events that students have to face. 
<br><br>
The professor's apology made me feel bad because I never thought about future generations and other parts of the world being affected by climate change. Even though I can have a great life using fossil fuels, the future generations are not. Also, using fossil fuels right now is hurting someone else across the globe. We do live in a society where we depend on fossil fuels which has blind me until now. I actually apologize for not paying attention to what's going on in this world. For not caring as much about other parts of the world that are in worst conditions than me.  My only concern now is our generation going to understand this problem soon and take it seriously. Are we just going to live life as it is until the world ends.  We have to spread word about this problem and make people realize how it could lead to a world of horror. Hopefully, as people, we have to unite and fix this problem before climate change is a big threat where we cannot fix and contain.

It is really cool how you expressed an understanding of the interconnectedness of the whole issue of climate change and how our actions, which may benefit us, are very damaging for people in other parts of the world. I think this is important because of how many people still are unaware or in denial about climate change. It seems that if they felt the direct effects of it like massive storms, flooding, wildfires, or unbearable heat, then maybe they would understand and feel as passionate as you are beginning to feel. It is an easy cause to support once one understands it so I think a big component of solving the climate crisis is helping people understand. 
<br><br>
I am also amazed by the small amount of time that it took to emit so much CO2. The measurement of a generation helps put it into perspective and gives a good representation of our unbelievable fossil fuel use during the past 60 years. I find the fact that almost 2/3 of the carbon was put in the atmosphere by three of the most powerful and developed countries incredible. Since we are where we are because of fossil fuels, I think the conclusion to draw from this is the enormous responsibility we have as the biggest consumers to be the biggest leaders in change. We have so much privilege as a result of being dominant fossil fuel consumers and we have a responsibility to change our habits and solve the climate crisis.

<p>
I’m frustrated about how the fossil fuel based economy and way of life have ruined the planet. My parent’s generation has seen the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere to 415 ppm which throughout their life time is 100 ppm. This is insane since it means that one generations decisions have doomed the rest of the world. I’ve been taught that our life spans are so small and insignificant to the history of the planet, but I no longer believe this. Just one generation’s actions have caused another 1 of 6 Earth’s mass extinctions. This is alarming. I’m beyond frustrated that this is the kind of life I have inherited. 
<br><br>
My parent’s and myself have been brought up in a society that is controlled by capitalism and consumerism. We’ve grown up with fossil fuel addictions and benefits. We are privileged to have these technologies and it will be hard to change our way of life but we must. We must change so that our children can live.

This is so true.  We have been brought into a society that sees this abuse of fossil fuels as the norm and are taught not to question it, simply taking it for granted.  However, this is the dangerous trap that our parents generation fell into.  It is now up to us to take a stand, change our ways, and live our lives making conscious decisions not to make the same mistakes.  At this point, we are left to fight for what we believe in and do what we can to combat this crisis.

In the lecture “The Climate Crisis as a generational issue”, is uplifting in that though these pressures to change the world are on our shoulders, there is still hope. More and more people believe in climate change. Where before the generation of our parents didn’t think about consumption and helping the planet. Now with the birth of social media the youth have a unique ability to share information and do something positive with social media platforms that can reach millions of people. A person like Greta Thunberg has millions of views on videos regarding climate change. That can inspire so many to change. 
<br><br> 
In the lecture “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, Ken discusses how the people that have brought on some of the most significantly measurable damage to the earth are still alive and still making it worse. Honestly, I found this to be a profound statement. The generation he is talking about is my parent’s generation. Thinking back to when I was younger and all the ways as a family we have contributed so much waste is disheartening. 
<br><br>
The time delay that Ken discusses has created a generational divide. Where we are now responsible for years of damage caused by people we love. Now, my beliefs no longer match those of my parents. My habits of consumption are not the same as those of my parents. I hope that my generation can help make significant changes.
</p><hr>

<p>
Both lecture videos, "The climate crisis as a generational issue" and "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime," emphasize the idea that the climate crisis comes from habits we don't fix. Although people in older generations didn't know their habits would lead to negative effects, some still fail to accept the idea that they contributed to the climate crisis. Ken's statement on how generations keep on teaching younger generations the same destructive habits shows me that the climate crisis is based on how people think. People continue to ignore the effects of fossil fuels because they don't see it as contributing to the problem. If people can't properly define the problem as a problem then to them there is nothing to fix. That's why I think Ken's apology and acknowledgement of his generation's and country's role in the climate crisis is so important. He's acknowledging the problem and realizes there is a need to change in order to make a difference. If more people were to think similarly then it would make a huge difference because people would feel more inclined to make an effort. The climate crisis isn't just a problem one generation can fix, it's a problem that requires all generations globally to fix.
</p><hr>

<p>
As discussed in “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” a major reason for the travesty we are living in is the delay in effects. We as a species are a greedy one in that we live in the now and only think of that. Most of the time we don't take into consideration the long term effects and only care about the short term. It's ridiculous that the people before us screwed up so bad and didn't care about the future their grandchildren would live in. I know for a fact that I won't make the same mistake they did. In their defense they weren't as knowledged of the climate as we are today but they were aware that there were consequences to all the CO2 they were releasing. Another disheartening thing is that children today are being raised by the same ignorant adults and being taught the same blatant lies. There is hope in the future of those to come but we need to act fast. The first step to a better future is to make sure everyone is fully aware and educated on the gravity and denounce all fake science that leads people to believe falsities such as how climate change is a hoax. The second is that we need to transition to fully renewable energy. There are plenty of ways to combat the problems but the most important part is we need to start now.

I was moved by professor Hiltner’s video and his apology. I think that it is important to be aware of our mistakes and to learn from them. It is the first week of the class and all the class material I have consumed has made me reflect on my lifestyle choices and wanting to make better decisions. I hope to live a life that helps the planet and is a part of bettering our home. 
<br><br>
I think the story of the one smoker impacting the life of thousands of people was a great way to put what we are doing to our planet. While hearing the story I thought about many people would still willingly do things that harm others and that it is unfair how others have to pay for someone else’s mistakes. I hope future children are able to live in a much better and greener planet that is sustainable. 
<br><br>
I recently had a conversation with some people about this class and they told me that it is not their fault that their culture eats meat and that it is imposed on them. When I heard this I felt a bit sad that we feel that we have to consume meat. Although it might feel like it is too late to correct our mistakes I hope we can all make better choices for a sustainable home.

I totally agree with your comment. I think it’s so crazy how so many people do things that harm others just because it has no detriment to themselves. I think as humans, we tend to be very shortsighted in our decisions. We consider how our actions will affect us now, or maybe how our actions will affect the rest of our lives. But what about after we leave this Earth? The lives of the generations that follow us are rarely considered in our everyday decisions, and this shortsighted thinking has been a major part of the reason that we have pumped a ridiculous amount of greenhouse gases. Knowing that it wouldn’t affect their own lifetimes, people of that generation irresponsibly used fossil fuels, leaving future generations to clean up their mess.
<br><br>
I think it is interesting that your friend found it difficult to see a path forward without meat because it feels imposed on them by their culture, because at times I feel the exact same way. Many times I have considered going vegan because of the amount of methane produced through the process of raising livestock for consumption. But then I think about how difficult a vegan lifestyle would be, not being able to eat dinners with my family, or not being able to go to my favorite KBBQ restaurants with my friends. Basic meals would require more effort to either make or seek out. After considering these consequences, I quickly back away from the thought. I think this is very similar to the situation with burning fossil fuels. It can be difficult to imagine moving forward without fossil fuels, ESPECIALLY for those who work on the field, i.e. coal miners who depend on those jobs and wouldn’t have other fields to turn to without them. However, returning to the previous point, we have to consider the lives of the generations who follow us. Perhaps it is time for us to make difficult sacrifices in our lives for the sake of those who are coming after us.

The two lectures, "The climate crisis as a generational issue" and "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" both suggest that the climate crisis we created now is a long time matter that future generation will suffer and pay for the past one. The data provides in the video really shocks me as the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere obviously increases exponentially just in about a single life time. As the lecture talks about, ppm has increased for about 1/3 in the past 60 years, and it is really hard for us to image how bad it will be in 2079. What we did for "development" caused this terrified situation and the effects will last for more than hundreds, or even thousands of years, which absolutely will influence our descendants.
<br><br>
Hopefully more people of the older generation will wake up, realize what they did wrong, and devote themselves to protect our atmosphere. Also younger generations should be taught more to avoid behaviors that will worsen the current situation. I believe under common efforts, the world will become better and better.
</p><hr>

<p>
In Professor Hiltner's video he touches primarily on the aspect of carbon dioxide being released into the air. Through his remorse for the outcome of his generations impact, one notices that certain people feel responsible for an issue that is being caused by many. Something that I believe needs to be done is to teach the younger generations what can be done because if we keep passing down the ideology of denial that climate change is real then, I do not see a change being made in the future. People like Greta Thungberg need to be who younger generations are looking up to. 
<br><br>
As said in the video, "there is still time to act" and once that is acknowledged then we'll finally being to make a difference. The United States has been one of the biggest neglectful countries. As mentioned by the statistics, the poorest countries contribute a significantly less amount of CO2 into the atmosphere than more developed countries. This is important to mention in my opinion because other countries look up to the U.S and for us to cause a problem that is affecting those who were not involved in the mistakes made sheds a bad light. It is important that we make changes in the environment now so that future generations can live in a world with less worries. We should not leave the problem to be fixed, instead fix it ourselves. This change will cause an impact on how future generations react to the topic. Although CO2 is the most known greenhouse gas, the other gases such as methane should also be talked about more because those other gases can cause more damage than CO2 if they are neglected. Rather than go one step at a time, maybe we need to take three.

<p>
In this lecture “How climate crisis was brought about in a generational issue,” points out how the generation before us has not done much in order to help save our planet. They saw what was happening when small changes on the planet started happening, but did nothing about it. Now, they, as the generation that they raised, continue to harm the planet during the climate crisis. I think that older people need to realize that what we do everyday will not only affect their future children and grandchildren, but the entire world. 
<br><br>
I understand that we all have to take action in order to prevent the damage from getting worse, but we have to teach each other about this. Our entire species will suffer and will not have a planet to live on if we don’t do anything. How are we going to be so selfish and not think of the generations to come. It is heartbreaking to think about how we may not suffer all of the consequences caused by climate change, but the next generation will. It is up to us to advocate for change in this climate crisis.
</p><hr>

<p>
By stating ““The climate crisis as a generational issue, Ken let us know that we should solve the environmental problem together. Though it is true that the climate crisis was brought about a single lifetime long, but due to the different regions. The pollution that an American citizen provides sine the 1970s still will be at least 100 times bigger than the pollution that one African people provided. Thus, ken feels sorry about the consequence that his generation has made and encourage us to make something different in order to let our offspring living peacefully in the future. Though the impact for us to change is tiny if we keep on this progress and encourage others to do together. Sooner or later the positive effect will be provided for our offspring. We should be responsible for not only them but also ourselves.
</p><hr>

<p>
The lecture "How the Climate Crisis was Brought in a Single Lifetime" shows the ignorance of the past generations, leaving us to fend against the climate change and drastic effects on the planet, being blamed for something they commenced. It's truly mind-bogging to think that in the past decades we have contaminated this Earth in such a short period time at an alarming rate surpassing the levels of past centuries and generations. in about 60 years, CO2 rose about 100 pt by far surpassing the past centuries, which is more than 3x increasing rate than in the past centuries.  I like the analogy to cigarette smoking and how the actions of a past generation (our ancestors) can affect the future descendants, having this dramatically profound effect in which we had no say or choice in, just born into it.

It's truly startling how 25% of the emissions that are within our atmosphere were put there by United States, despite only making 4% of the population and if you include Europe and Russia, in the past 60years, they were all responsible for 2/3 of all emissions. But, on the other, the poorest 3 billion people in the world, a little less than half the population, only contributed about 5% of the carbon in the air. Yet, we still blame over population for the excessive emissions and pollution, but not our constant greed and disgusting ignorance. And the worse part of it all, is that we continue our ways on the daily perpetually dooming our planet.

<p>
This video along with “The climate crisis as a generational issue” shine a light on the injustice and lack of direct consequences that come along with climate change, and even fuel the lack of acknowledgment. Those who produce the most atmospheric pollution are not the same people who suffer most from in. In fact many of the biggest air pollutant producers have the wealth and technology to temporarily offset many of the discomforts and challenges in climate change. The fact that just ⅛ of the world is responsible for the vast majority of the pollution further adds to the injustice and inhumanity that comes with our emission choices. The fact that polluters are separate from the results, both in time and through advantages from wealth, sadly makes it easier to justify actions that we know are bad. The concept of “fossil fuel addiction,” stemming from the fact that many societies are now built around fossil fuel use, only adds to the fear about our destruction of our own planet.

Both "The Climate crisis as a generational issue" and "How the climate was a brought about in a single lifetime"  make it apparent that the issues of global climate change is recent and rapidly increasing. An interesting concept that Ken acknowledged was a factor in letting the problem of climate change grow was the idea of a delayed effect. I found the analogy of cigarette smoking very eye-opening. By not being able to see the effects of our destructive action immediately, we've done some extensive harm to the planet and all life that inhabit it. Although this is very depressing information, I found Professor Ken's optimism comforting. Despite our abuse of fossil fuels, people have not given up hope that this damage is reversible.  After watching these videos I understand how climate change is a problem that is being unwillingly inherited by my generation. I am confident that major strides are being made towards unifying as a human race and solving the problem that is global climate change.

As Ken points out, the "delayed impact" of climate change is a major factor contributing to how the world got to the state it's in today. When people don't experience immediate negative repercussions for their actions, they tend to continue toxic behavior because they either don't realize or don't care that the effects will eventually follow. With most Americans, they've become so used to the daily luxuries that come from this system they've grown up with that they truly are facing a "fossil fuel addiction," as Ken aptly names it. If they've been told their whole lives that the way in which they're living is not harmful, it can be difficult for them to change their opinion and their way of life. The facts, however, cannot be ignored.
<br><br>
Young people today have grown up in a world that's dealing increasingly with the harrowing repercussions of our country's irreverent attitude toward the world in which we live. From this perspective, ignoring the effects of global climate change is simply not plausible, as they have a major impact on both our current lives and our  collective future. The sheer number of environmental tragedies we hear about, growing at an exponential rate, is truly alarming, and this unwelcoming climate we live in today is not like the world we hear about in stories of the past. The sad truth about climate change, however, is that those who are most responsible for its causes will suffer its effects the least, while poorer nations struggle to cope and younger generations look forward into an increasingly bleak future.

<p>
"The climate crisis as a a generational issue" and "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" explained the prolonged effects of human carelessness and economic greed. For many generations, as the videos touch upon, humanity has fallen into a cycle of overuse, depletion, and destruction. We never really accounted for the consequences of our actions, these actions being guided by self-interest, self-gain, and convenience. I always found it ironic how my generation is always talked negatively about, being the group of people coming into adulthood with an addiction to technology and fast production. However, there is never a reflection into the past as much. Yes, we definitely have grown up with greater versions of technological advances but this was from the beginning of which we had entered this world. We do have a significant footprint on the world with our choice of transportation or even food choices. However, we are also part of the population that is now suffering due to the decisions in the past that had geared societies towards a path of fueled with a constant desire for more and for it to be at our fingertips faster. This demand, of course, is met by the producers and those in the government, people that I have come to realize may wrongly have too much power over everyone on this planet. These people that are supposedly working to do the best for the people seem to be ignoring one of the most pressing issues of all time. How will the people survive if the planet is inhabitable? There may be consistent denial but I don't feel as though this can or should be going on for nay longer. This however is dependent on the people, the people being more conscious of their decisions and the state of the environment in areas that are not their home, because in the end no one will be safe from a dying planet. This will only arise once division is dissipated and everyone acknowledges the consequences of their actions and taking responsibility for blindly participating in a society that is not sustainable for the future.

<p>
In the lectures, “The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue” and “How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime” both address how our detrimental climate issues were brought upon because of the older generations. Their massive burning of fossil fuels, in part with their negligence that still withstands today as much as it did in the past, has now led to an inhabitable environment for them and their generations to come. This long term generational issue is one that needs to be brought upon the educational surface (much like ours) to decipher its true emergence and how the issues from almost a centennial ago affect our ongoing lives today. With a class like ours in our generation today, its popularity is understandable and the count of nine hundred students is justified. We saw what our parents and grandparents started and decided we will no longer take part in the killing of the only place we call home. The most surprising aspect of  “How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime” was how majorly complacent the United States is to this crisis. Despite only constituting four percent of the world’s population, we have contributed to ¾ of the world’s CO2 emissions, while three billion of the world’s poorest population only admitted to five percent of the CO2 in our atmosphere. It is incredibly baffling to me how one of the most developed countries has the power to completely turn this issue entirely around, but it instead looks the other way. They do not believe it is their job to fix their mistakes simply because they are not the ones who are directly affected by it, and although they have the wealth and power to amass an issue as great as this, they would rather use this same control to hide behind their mistakes and place the blame onto those who do not hold the same title. This gross abuse of power not only shows how corrupt this nation is, but how easy it is for them to hand off their responsibilities onto those who simply do not have the means to fight back.
</p><hr>

<p>
I think that much of the public, like myself, before taking this course, is unaware of the major fact that the climate crisis was brought about in a single generation, essentially the last 60 years. I previously assumed that the buildup to our current climate crisis was a result of the Second Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, with the invention of electricity and discovery of petroleum. This is indeed a precursor to the current climate crisis, but it definitely did not significantly contribute to the crisis as much as the massive burning of fossil fuels and release of carbon dioxide that humans have done in the past 60 years. This is definitely a fact that should be stressed more and more, placing necessary responsibility of those who caused this crisis to work toward and acknowledge that a solution is needed.
<br><br>
By simplifying the explanation to the cigarette example, Prof. Hiltner effectively explains how the climate crisis is also a form of inequality that favors the rich over the poor. Even though the richest people of the world are the ones that created this problem, the poorest people are the ones being most directly affected and experiencing the consequences. 
<br><br>
Like Prof. Hiltner said above, the younger generation in 2020 is now taking action in order to rebel and protest against the crisis that the previous generation has caused, and are demanding change. However, even with the aggravated younger generation rebelling from below, with little Lilliputian movements in themselves, action is not happening fast enough for repair the damage that has accumulated and is now taking significant effect. The people within the generation that caused the climate crisis continues to actively deny the science and threat of the current climate crisis, and continues to rapidly pollute the planet in order to maximize their own profits. Even most of the younger generation continues to rely on fossil fuels and continue the waste of our planet's resources with the current lifestyle. I believe that with the dire threat of this issue, both the older generation and younger generation needs to collaborate and take action together in order to solve this issue. We must all shift our way of life to more sustainable sources of energy and wane our dependence of fossil fuels, in order to decrease our greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.
</p><hr>

<p>
I think these videos brought forth a discussion on the topic that is often overlooked by the media, which is the generational difference in attitudes and action towards climate change. My generation is routinely chastised by the media and politicians for protesting and taking a stand, whether it be for gun violence or climate change. We are told to sit down and shut up because we don't know what we're talking about, but as Ken brings up in his videos, we are the ones that are going to suffer in the horrible living conditions that the past generations have allowed to manifest. We have to take action because of the previous generations' inaction. Greta Thunberg is an idol who everyone should be looking to for a reminder of how serious the issues are, and yet she is talked down to and criticized by climate deniers. The youth is taking action and paying attention more than ever about the climate and it is exactly what is needed to combat the boomers and older generations who do not see climate change as an issue that needs to be dealt with. 
<br><br>
My dad is a boomer and it is crazy to think that the majority of the CO2 emissions have come from his lifetime and its effects will be felt in my lifetime. My father, like Ken, feels horrible for the repercussions that we will have to suffer due to their generations' aversion towards the issue. Unfortunately the mass consumption and throwaway culture is deeply ingrained in my generation as well through fast fashion, food waste and obsession with luxurious houses and cars which are seen all throughout social media and Hollywood. I know myself that I am guilty of contributing to the problem as well since I grew up in a culture of consumption and waste. While my generation is the most aware of the severity of the issue and proactive in calling for change, most of us still partake in an unsustainable lifestyle and need to be ready to adapt and make changes to our lifestyle as well as use our voting power to show up to the ballots and vote for candidates that are committed to slowing climate change. The analogy of the cigarettes is very real and a great analogy of how the issue is going to be felt. Unfortunately most people do no act until it affects them personally and visibly, otherwise it seems like a distant and vague possibility in the future that doesn't affect them. It is hard to effectively make people feel the consequences of imminent climate change but hopefully the youth's recognition of the issue is able to be felt through future elections, especially the presidential election this year. I feel like that is the easiest way to be able to create change is by changing who is running the government and creating policies that affect the environment. The videos were very remorseful but insightful and is needed to be able to bring awareness of the issue to people so they can bring power to the polls.
</p><hr>

<p>
The generational aspect of the climate crisis as described in this lecture is increasingly impactful when coming from a member of the generation at fault. This is especially true in this movement as the movement tends to come from the affected younger generation as opposed to the one at fault.  The most interesting part for me about the generational aspect of this issue is the time delay in the consequences of actions in terms of climate change. The fact that the release of so much CO2 into the atmosphere by Ken’s generation had a time delay in terms of the visible consequences, clarifies the generational aspect much more for me than before I understood this. Even worse, this generation has brought up another with the same "addictions" that led to the crisis in the first place, a seemingly endless cycle. When problems, and even worse addictions, become vast and translate to a global scale their solutions tend to seem almost out of reach. This harsh truth can often cause people to lose hope, which is perhaps the worst thing that we can do at this point in time.
<br><br>
In addition to this generational issue, the most devastating part of this climate crisis as outlined in this lecture is the aspect of economic inequality. On a global scale, the richest countries in the world have put ⅔ of the CO2 in the atmosphere, and with the profits from it are largely able to escape the consequences. On the contrary, the poorest countries and people while not having contributed to any large part of the crisis will be the ones to take the brunt of the consequences. These facts seem almost too unfair to fathom from a species that claims to be the best, the top of the food chain, untouchable by anything else on this planet. The irony that such a species would be single-handedly responsible for destroying a planet that gave it the opportunity to thrive is the devastating reality.  When faced with such a shattering truth one must come to realize that radical problems require radical solutions.
</p><hr>

<p>
Professor Hiltner indicates in the first video “The climate crisis as a generational issue” that what people do to the environment greatly bring negative influence to the next generation, which means we are suffering the burden of climate change caused by the previous generation. I think the thing that we need to do right now is not blaming, rather, we should actively engage in the climate issue and prevent the same thing from happening again to our descendants. As Hiltner says, the movement is a good way to call people’s attention and propagate our attitudes of protecting the environment. 
<br><br>
    The second video, “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, further enforces the idea. Hiltner wisely let us imagine that what we do will largely damage our descendants, reminding people to stop these irresponsible behaviors. More importantly, I am shocked by the huge contrast between developed countries with fossil capitalism that produce huge amount of CO2 and developing countries that produce insignificant amount. In spite of this, people in developing countries suffer more from the climate crisis rather than those who really cause it. The apology in the end touches me and urges me to try a more sustainable lifestyle and avoid making the same mistake.
</p><hr>

<p>
I find it interesting that Professor Hiltner starts off the class by going about the climate issue as a generational problem. Something that Ken said that stuck with me the most was the fact that 75% of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere happened over the span of his own lifetime. This fact combined with inaction and delayed consequences of climate change I thought were the main takeaways from this lecture. It seems to me that there are a great many problems in general that might generation will have to deal with, and the issue of climate change is by far the biggest of my lifetime. Many people don’t realize that this issue doesn’t just affect one person in their lifetime, but it negatively affects many future generations of Americans and people all around the world. Climate change isn’t just one person’s problem or even one country’s problem. It is an issue that has enveloped the entire world, brought about by first world countries and our unprecedented burning of fossil fuels from the year Ken has been talking about; 1959. While the issue of climate change can be solved and hopefully its effects can be reversed, I realize now more than ever that we aren’t just fighting for the well being of our own lives and our own generation, but every other generation that comes after us. 
<br><br>
Not only has the issue of climate change been drastically unrepresented, it has now taken the form of a problem that will jump from generation to generation. Blaming Ken’s generation for causing this problem isn’t entirely fair; in fact I believe that going back to what he said earlier, around 400 years ago in England the burning of soft coal and other harmful material is partly what began to change the Earth’s climate, although not as major of a change as from 1959 to 2019 when the PPM jumped 100 points. The issue of climate change has been ignored for hundreds of years, Ken’s generation wasn’t the only one that added to the problem. This issue came about when the idea that any corporation or company can burn as much fossil fuel as they want without being sanctioned or punished for adverse effects on the environment. It's the mindset or the culture of big, rich, powerful first-world countries to justify destroying the world in order to increase their country’s wealth. This to me is unacceptable. Protesting and other people-led demonstrations are helpful to draw attention to the subject. However, if we really want to reverse the effects of climate change, we need to focus on people who profit the most from climate change. People like the Koch brothers or other big fossil fuel interest groups are the ones fueling climate change. This is just one step we need to take to further combat climate change.
</p><hr>

<p>
In the “The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue” lecture and “How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime” lecture, older generations were blamed for their massive burning of fossil fuels and neglecting the consequences of emitting too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Their neglect led to our current planet which is heading to an uninhabitable environment for human beings and other species. Instead of correcting their mistakes, they have raised another generation before us that continued their atrocity to the planet. Things could be fine if they realized what they have done was disastrous to the climate, but they did not. I do respect Mr. Ken for his apology representing the older generation; however, I think that those who still resist the fact of global warming should be the ones to apologize. They not only made all those mistakes, but they also refuse to admit their wrongdoings. Yet, the most urgent thing to do for our generation is to actually get our hands on to solve the problem instead of blaming on older generations since it is not going to change the climate or cool down the planet at all. We have to settle the problem before we actually start to work through whom should be blamed for. In fact, our descendent would judge that from their vantage point.
</p><hr>

<p>
It would be incredibly easy to entirely blame the older generations for what they have done; as described in the second lecture, “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, over a very short period, an astronomical amount of damage has ensued. As Ken acknowledges, near 75% of carbon dioxide emissions currently trapped in the atmosphere were emitted during his lifetime. This also means that the instigators of the CO2 spike are still alive and still perpetuating the climate crisis. How can I not be livid? My future has essentially been stolen from me; I have been denied the planet my parents and grandparents were given and am instead expected to fix their massive problems not for myself, but for future generations and humanity. The hypocrisy has instilled in me a sense of obligation that the older generations clearly did not possess to create fast, drastic change that I will never observe the effect of, let alone reap the benefits from. As explained in the cigarette metaphor, the short-term actions in the past displayed no immediate threat, due to a time delay, a latency of effects and catastrophes. Ken is right; the older generation should be ashamed. Though as I mentioned, my own generation, myself included, should be too; they have failed us, and now we are failing ourselves.
<br><br>
It bewilders me that some of my peers do not share my sense of fear and urgency, that they are content in satisfying their own needs with reckless abandon for future generations. However, collectively, we ignorantly accept the behavior of our predecessors and casually abuse the planet we live on. Though as the first lecture video, “The climate crisis as a generational issue”, emphasizes, the many youth are rising up against the institutions, systems, governments, and ideologies that originally sent humanity barreling down its current track to devastation. I wholeheartedly support these movements and am a Greta Thunberg admirer, though I still believe it is not enough. We are but one generation. We are the future of humanity, though right now, we don’t make up the entire global population. We are fighting old values, old business, old white men. We often lose. Though I will agree with Ken once more in that there is still time, and the younger generation seems to be headed towards a better track.
</p><hr>

<p>
While the climate crisis may have been brought about in a single lifetime due to the technologies and economic factors behind/bolstering it, the values that led to such a lifestyle did not. They have developed through human civilization and I believe that is why this is such a difficult issue to address for many older generations. It’s not that I believe that these generations are not to be held accountable, but rather I believe we, as a whole, need to make drastic changes that are new to us all. Just as some of the younger generations have become dependent on fossil fuels; ex. getting their own car at 16 or eating meat at least once a day or the huge dependence on technology that we have developed (phones, laptops, TVs, etc.), the generations before us were taught values and ideals that let innovation and “smoking” run rampant without thought for their consequences. 
<br><br>
The youth have been a catalyst in the fight for climate justice, but they aren’t the only ones who should be relied on to make a difference. I do not believe that there needs to be a generational split on the issues surrounding the climate crisis. We are all learning about its effects as we go, and I think we should all be adapting and changing. I don’t think you have to be a young person just to be able to change. 
<br><br>
The climate crisis is often placed down onto the shoulders of the younger generations. The amount of times that I have heard “Your generation will fix this,” or “Your generation will save us all,” is ridiculous! We will fix this issue if we all work together, united between generations. Therefore, do not apologize, but rather keep doing the work that you are doing and know that you are part of the solution as well.
</p><hr>

<p>
Both of these snippets have significant meanings rather than just a professor speaking aloud. There is a message that we need to obtain in out thick skulls that in which if we do not it will be too late. A message that we need to intake in order to save the next generations to come because of the consequences previous ones have left us to deal with. It is shown teenagers/ young adults protesting over the matter of climate change. I myself have been involved in several protests but it seems we have not gotten our word across. We are bringing attention to the devastations around us. As we speak there is carbon dioxide being exposed to Earths atmosphere, although we may not be able to completely end CO2 emissions, we are able to voice our opinions and make in dent to decrease such emissions. Day to day news articles televised reports, even ads on social media come across us no matter where we are. Does nobody find this a significant matter? Do these monsters of politicians not see what they are doing. Literal facts are being presented and still nothing is being done to eliminate such problems. As seen on the second video the United States counts for at least a quarter, maybe more, of the emission of carbon dioxide. Way much more than the undeveloped counties in which outnumber the United States population by millions. It scares me to think if that doesn't make a person worried, who knows what will. There will come a day when non-believers will finally realize that there is such a thing as global warming or in other words climate change, but once it gets to that point it may be too late. A point to where we will not be able to reverse what previous generations have done and life as we know it is destroyed.
</p><hr>

<p>
Both "The climate crisis as a generational issue" and "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" put into perspective the urgency and timing surrounding climate change. For the longest time, I believed that the exponential increase in greenhouse gas emissions and overall human wastefulness stemmed from the Industrial Revolution, which may be partly true. However, now I see that climate change rapidly grew more complex and worrisome within the past 60 years or so, an alarmingly short amount of time in my opinion. It's quite disheartening to see just how much the developed Western world contributes to carbon emissions at 66.67%, while almost half of the world's population barely accounts for 5% of carbon emissions. One would think that developed countries hold enough influence to where sustainable farming and energy sources could be achieved effortlessly, but this seems to be far from the truth due to the utter lack of reliable and effective environmental legislation. The fact that it doesn't even take a large percentage of people to sustain the devastating effects of climate change makes matters worse, as solutions to these problems appear to be even more inconceivable than before unless broad action is taken swiftly. The vulnerability of developing nations like Bangladesh becomes more apparent when contrasting their environmental issues brought about by human-driven climate change with the wealth and security possessed by developed nations like the United States that shield them from the dire environmental consequences, at least for now; this injustice shouldn't be tolerated by anyone, especially by those who have been affected the most by climate change. I wish more people knew about the developmental divide that exists and the irony regarding the major and minor contributors to climate change since I think this would inspire more people to take climate change seriously and involve themselves with movements that seek to right humanity's environmental wrongs so that future generations can be handed a healthy, habitable planet instead of a mountain of worries and stress.

<p>
The lectures for week one, “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime," worked well to help shed light upon the current circumstances surrounding the climate crisis as well as how it came about. The conversation around the climate crisis has been ever shifting as it has gone through universal concern, skepticism, and arguments time and time again. In the first lecture, Ken touches upon the current generation and how their upbringing has coincided with a realization of the consequences of the climate crisis. His words on the subject made me reflect upon my own contributions toward the climate crisis and how I want to develop my role in fighting against it. During high school, I volunteered a few times for my local environmental nonprofits, but I have not done as much in college. I am greatly appreciative of the fact that my coming into adulthood has also coincided with a great leap in the movement against climate change in the form of activism, like Greta Thunberg, the Sunrise movement, etc. And I will continue to evaluate the issue and try to help contribute in more ways.
<br><br>
A great part of the second lecture was dedicated to an analogy regarding the long term generational impact of climate change. This analogy really helped in connecting the information provided and my experiences in reality. Sure, fossil fuels have immensely contributed to the easy going and comfortable life that people in the developed world are able to enjoy. However, the consequences for the lifestyles lived in the past 60 years have already started to come to fruition. I hope that educating the public through formats like this lecture series and activism through the various organizations and movements throughout the nation will again establish the United States as a leader against the climate crisis.

I admire how learning about our generation's place within the climate crisis motivates you to develop your role in fighting against it. Just after this first week, I feel a lot of pressure on our generation, almost in the sense that I start to feel guilty if I'm not on the streets protesting or posting on my social media relevant climate crisis info and news to spread the word. It also feels as if our generation is the last straw, the final chance, it's on us to make change for another turning point, and it would be too late for the generation following ours to be the saviors. 
<br><br>
In this sense, a part of Ken's apology intrigued me. The part where he apologized for not raising our generation to live sustainably on this planet. Just like how we talk about learning a different language or learning how to code becoming a normalized part of the educational curriculum, what if there were sole courses on "Climate Change" or "Sustainability" in our elementary, middle and high school education? Implementing such a change in our core curriculums would be a tough challenge when we still have politicians who do not believe in climate change, but the thought of raising newer generations with skills in sustainability is an exciting thought.

I think it's great that more and more young people are standing up for change concerning the climate change crisis. It's hard to come up with a plan to quickly turn the tide while still keeping economy intact, but we shouldn't just pretend the problem isn't there. Something definitely needs to be done before it's too late. The world needs to realize that some loss in profit from finding alternatives to fossil fuels is better than the catastrophe to come if we continue to really on fossil fuels.

I like how you mentioned that the solution or plan has to keep our economy intact because I think it's something that gets ignored in today's conversation about climate change. The sad truth is, the likelihood is that most people's lifestyles and most businesses' practices won't change in a way that combats climate change unless there is some form of economic incentive to guiding that change. Since people don't immediately see the impacts of climate change in their everyday life it is unlikely they will feel compelled to change on their own.

What is most compelling is that the United States is one of the world's leading
contributors to climate crisis yet because of our careless, unsustainable
environmental choices in using fossil fuels, we are hardly feeling the effects.
On the other hand, like you explained, the developing nations have contributed
little to no harm to our earth's atmosphere, yet they will be the ones
suffering from our ignorance. This is mind-boggling to me because I believe
that they have no right to be suffering the effects, when we are the ones
responsible. After all, we have the "luxury" of technology and
medicine that can protect us from suffering from self-induced disease and
self-induced global warming while the people living in developing countries
will have little to no ways to fend for themselves due to the fact that many
are living in poverty. That to me is unjust. Unhuman. I believe that we owe
them the recourses they need to live comfortably but also sustainably. It is a
problem that not only the previous generation engineered but also mine, and for
that, I feel that the United states and other leading contributors to climate
change owe  developing nations an apology
and a solution.

Something that struck out to me after watching "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" was that a quarter of all the CO2 in the atmosphere is put there by the United States, while the poorest 3 billion people in the world contributed to only 5% of the CO2 on earth. With the ability to do so much and all of the resources they have, global leaders and citizens of the worlds biggest economies need to step up and take action. We need to change the way we live and not put such a massive carbon footprint on the earth. It was also shocking to me to hear that in the next twenty years, if people in the developed countries continue on path with how much CO2 we put into the atmosphere, we would put more CO2 into the atmosphere than the entire human history. Even more disgusting is the fact that the other half of the world's population has almost nothing to do with this degradation of our planet, and yet their kids will be the ones to suffer the most from it for generations to come.
</p><hr>

<p>
I agree with Ken that this timely delay of the effects of the greenhouse gas build up is the true problem, and not necessarily CO2 itself. From English 22, I have learned that CO2 is not inherently bad. It does serve a great purpose in warming our planet and without it, our planet would be uninhabitable. However these large amounts of greenhouse gases that we have been releasing into the atmosphere to sustain our current lifestyles are starting to catch up with us. As Ken pointed out, the generation before us students heightened the issue by not only dumping these hazardous gases into the atmosphere, but also raising us to do the same thing with these lifestyles we have grown up in. Especially growing up in America, Russia, or Europe. I was shocked when I first heard that 25% of all emissions comes from America whose population constitutes only 4% of the world population, and the poorest 3 billion people in the world which is almost 50% of the world population contributes to only 5% of total emissions. As Americans, I believe since we are the chief contributors to the issue, we should be the leaders in executing a reversal. As Ken proposed today, solutions that are better than implementing renewable energy sources are reducing food waste, transitioning into a  plant-based diet, and educating women on reliable birth control to reduce human population. Although changing from an american-japanese diet may be tough, I believe it is worth it as I do not want my kids to suffer with an overheating planet. If action is not taken seriously and soon, the problem will only get worse.
</p><hr>

<p>
How history has played out over the course of the last 60 plus years has revealed that there is a generational gap in the climate crisis. Ken apologizes for the actions of is generation, and however much it may be appreciated, I personally find it unproductive to dwell on the failures of his generation. We cannot go back and change what has already been done in his time to accelerate climate change. What is more productive is to realize that it is undoubtedly this generation’s only chance to save the earth from complete destruction. Yes, it feels unfair that it is now our job to deal with the crisis, but once again we cannot change the fact that we were born in this time and we must continue to address the situation promptly and maturely to hopefully save our species and generations to come.
<br><br>
As of climate injustice however, it gives us a deeper context to understand the world today. How is it that 1/8th of the world’s population is creating two thirds of all emissions? It reminds me how selfishly the U.S. and other developed countries has acted in this time, and how I have also been a part of the problem. I claim to be climate conscious but what have I done with my privilege to lessen my own carbon footprint? Living in one of the leading countries in the world, I should be most willing to make small sacrifices that the poorest 3 billion might not be able to do. Eating less meat? Doable. Driving less, carpooling more? Achievable. Disadvantaged people in developing countries should not have to deal with the selfishness of the wealthy and privileged. It is the top few percent of people in this world, and the few leading countries that have the privilege to try their impact in the climate crisis because we do not immediately feel the effects of displacement, food shortages, and extreme weather patterns in some places. It is necessary to acknowledge our impact (as countries and individuals) first before the climate crisis can even begin to be resolved.
</p><hr>

<p>
In the video, it shows that human actions can influence thousands of thousands other species. The CO2 in the atmosphere has increased dramatically. The fossil fuels that industries released is parts of the problems. It is somewhat unfair of the other species or of the poor people. In the video, the poor people only take up about five percent of the CO2 release,but they suffer about the crisis, too. Human actions that destruct the ecosystem is to destruct themselves. We need to reduce the emission in order to keep the habitable earth. We don’t want to destruct our own  home. In addition, we don’t want to make our offsprings to suffer what we did as the video talks about. We need to have some actions to bring back our habitable earth.
</p><hr>

<p>
In my opinion, "The climate crisis as a generational issue" and "How the crisis has brought about in a single lifetime" perfectly illustrate how climate change and human actions have been greatly impacting our world. As the professor says, past generations are definitely one influence that creates the current situation on our planet. However, it’s extremely essential that we, current generation and the youth activists, should truly be aware of how we actually are negatively contributing to the environment. Take smoking as an example, my dad quit smoking 20 years ago, and I can say that I’ve been observing and acknowledging that more and more people, or particularly men, in the past generations have quit smoking for some reason. As we understand how CO2 emission is continuously affecting our earth, we, as a youth, should also know that smoking is definitely making people around us unhealthy, and more importantly, making the global issue more serious. To conclude, not only past generations have the responsibility for the crisis but the youths have to be clever and wise about how we are also making the situation worse without actually taking actions but only carrying out rebellions.
</p><hr>

<p>
In both of Ken's videos, it was emphasized that the gap between his generation and ours was one of a lot of learning and we have a lot more people fighting for change. It disappoints me so greatly that both of our generations still have people who don't believe in climate change. The ignorance that I see blatantly being put out on the news and screamed from the top of Donald Trump's lungs is so worrying primarily because this problem isn't going to affect us in a century from now or even fifteen years from now, it's affecting us right now. The underdeveloped countries will suffer the most pain when it comes to this crisis, even though they've created the smallest fraction of actual carbon dioxide emissions. Its absolutely unfair to them, and our lack of aid in these countries doesn't help matters.
<br><br>
In addition, the human quality Ken mentioned where people tend to be unaware of consequences until they’re affecting every aspect of others’ lives is something I thought was totally applicable to climate change. People in the 1950’s thought that the planet was invincible because there wasn’t even the slightest repercussion for their actions, and because they lived like that, they don’t feel as though we will suffer either. Our futures are now hanging on by a thread because of their actions, in addition to even the smallest possibility of our children having proper lives.
</p><hr>

<p>
What struck me the most from this video is how future generations will be living through the consequences spawned from our present issues. The earth is being bombarded by more and more carbon to a point where the majority of the human race will be affected. Like Ken elaborates, our current inaction will hinder our children and grandchildren from experiencing a healthy life, free from the dangers of climate change. Including this form of pathos presents the climate crisis on an even greater level, for it poses a future that affects descendants of you and I. Listening to Ken speak on how ¾ of the carbon dioxide emitted into the earth’s atmosphere was put there in a single lifetime puts into perspective how badly our future generations will be impacted by our actions. It is true—we are raising our children to ultimately make the same mistakes us and previous generations have been making, instead of working towards a collective solution.
<br><br>
Shown in the video, many of the youth of today are finding their voice through protests and public displays of voicing their opinions. Unfortunately, the statistics on PPM of CO2 in the atmosphere prove how more than young voices are needed to spark change. Like Ken stated in lecture, the youth of today must take it upon themselves to vote for leaders who believe in climate change, and who will take the actions necessary to attain change from human beings. Seeing how the United States is responsible for about a quarter of the world's carbon in the atmosphere, you would think that politicians would try to find outlets to lessen the amount of fossil fuels being used, or propose alternative solutions such as including a carbon tax while decreasing tax on[less harmful] items.

I like how you included the pathos argument into your comment. I think that the idea of working to ensure a healthy future for the descendants of our families is a strong enough reason in itself to fight against the unsustainable practices that our developed world partakes in today. Although I think it is important to consider our own personal future generations, I can,t help but to also think of the future generations of those in developing countries. I found is disheartening when Ken explained how our future generations will be more insulated from the initial harm of climate issues due to our blatant wealth and better status of living. Finally, your emphasis on the importance of voting is one that resonated with me. Although individual actions and climate strikes are great to bring awareness to issues, I believe it really is going to take larger structural changes to our society as a whole in order to halt some of the negative climate practices our predecessors designed, and continue to exploit in the name of economic profit. Ultimately, I agree wholeheartedly when you question why politicians are not currently looking for fossil fuel outlets or alternatives when the science is clearly showing the exponential rates of carbon humans are burning.

The discussion of climate change has become so apparent within recent years. It was mentioned in school, on the news, pages on the topic can even be found on social media. So I felt that I had a solid understanding of what climate change is and how the world is changing because of it. But after watching the lecture video “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” and the movie “Before the Flood” my views have quickly changed. What I found to be extremely shocking was how recently the issue of climate change was brought about just 60 years ago and how quickly the CO2 levels have risen in those 60 years. Even more so it was sad and appalling to hear that the United States alone contributes ¼ of the Earth’s atmospheric CO2 meanwhile the poorest 3 billion people only contribute about 5 percent and they are the ones who are most affected by all of this. And many of the people here in the US and other developed countries who caused this problem are only making it worse as Professor Hitler stated but what they don’t realize is that it’s the problem the younger generations have to deal with. And the worse part of this all is that the climate crisis could have been solved before it got to this point but it was failed to be acknowledge as a crisis because of that period Hitlner mentioned where the consequences were delayed.
</p><hr>

<p>
Prior to this video, the impact of how fast the world's CO2 levels are rising was never clear to me. The magnitude of how little time we have left to fix this issue was not expressed in a way that was easy for me to visualize. I have always just acknowledged that climate change was a problem but never truly understood the gravity of it. This video, however, really expressed in concrete examples how much our generation and the next generations will be affected by the rising levels of CO2. The smoking analogy was an interesting way of explaining how the previous generations have unknowingly exploited fossil fuels to the extent to affecting the lives of the future generations greatly. The depiction of how the US has been contributing the most to rising CO2 levels is interesting because we are seen as one of the more influential and powerful countries, but are the main reason why the future generation may not have a decided future. I also appreciate the ways in which the younger people of today are taking immediate action to solve this issue. However, the previous generation is still the main peoples in power right now, and it is hard to convince them to do something that is a complete 180 from what they've known how to do all their lives, continue burning fossil fuels with no consequences.

After watching the lectures, I also felt better informed about the impacts that rising CO2 levels are having on the environment. I agree with you that the smoking analogy served useful in depicting the chain reaction that is taking place on our climate as a result of the generations that came before ours. I believe that this analogy also highlights the impacts that the current generation is capable of having on the following generations. Professor Hiltner did a good job of bringing to light the important job that many people of our generation have taken upon themselves to expose the hazards of climate change and seek reform for the damage that has already been done. I think that it is very important for the younger generation of people to continue to seek positive changes for our planet and to push that agenda onto the politicians that currently control the powerful countries that are producing so much of the greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. I think that if enough people continuously voice their concerns about climate change that change will begin sooner than later, which is imperative seeing as the state of the climate crisis is only getting worse and worse.

The lectures demonstrate the devastating consequences of industrialized consumption and how the problems will persist and escalate through the future generations. I really find it saddening that the causes of the horrific effects of modern industrialized living are literally happening right in front of me, in fact I'm a part of it. It made me aware that radical changes must to be made now and any further delay is worsening the problem. Our dependence on carbon will entail a radical change, but I think if people across political divides are made aware of the issue and provide active support, then seemingly impossible achievements can be attained.
<br><br>
I find the cigarette analogy particularly fascinating because smoking is addictive and destructive,  just like our current way of consumption. The lecture puts emphasis on our dependence on coal, fossil fuel, and carbon energy sources. In a way, I see the developed world, particularly countries likes the United States, as being addicted to carbon energy sources as they are cheap and productive. Just like cigarettes, the benefits of such consumption are short lived and temporary while the consequences are delayed but inevitable. As mentioned by the lecture, the time delay was a major factor in climate change. If deaths rates from cigarettes remained the same but the death was immediate, there would be far less people smoking. Similarly, because the consequences weren't immediate,  the destructive consumption continued unchecked until the planet was at a state of crisis.

"The climate crisis as a generational issue" showed us that many individuals are making the effort to make a difference for a better future of the environment. This entire video is a great reminder about how and who caused this problem that we must continue to strive to find the solution to this disaster. It is astonishing to discover that the United States population was the main contribution to the overall damage by 25 percent even though our population is only 4 percent in this entire planet. It is very disturbing to see how we constantly abuse our planet when this constant abuse can eventually permanently damage our home to the point where there will be nothing left to call it our home. Also, it is disheartening to see that poorer countries have to suffer the consequences because what the wealthy and big industries have done to the planet. Their homes are being destroyed from the careless actions the wealthy has brought upon the environment. This video is a good reminder that our generation and the future generation must act together to fix this issue or else it could be too late later on.

Nowadays we can see that there are more and more activists/movements, policies being made and articles being published to call for attention for climate change problems. But still I don’t really see an obvious change on the problem that has already existed, but instead like what Professor Hiltner you have said in the video, the generations that have made the problem years and years ago are still here who are still not well aware of the problem and as we can see, the old and new generation are all creating problems even now day by day on our earth. I don’t think we should spend time on figuring out who made the problem on the earth in a way like this, the more important thing we should be paying attention to is understand what makes us failed to take quick action and call for changes and how we can do it. I really like the example that Professor Hiltner has mentioned in the video about the cause-and-effect model. Almost everyone I know around me even include myself before I understand the seriousness of climate change problem, we all treat is as a minor problem because it didn’t cause something huge and serious directly to each individual. When it only happens in a small part or some places on earth, people who are not witnessing it or experiencing it don’t know how much bad impacts global warming/climate change has brought out the natural disasters/events,etc and the effect it has on people’s lives and our sustainability to live on the planet. I do think that the planet is not something that is created for us to exhaust it and it is not a place for us to use for own economic benefits, we really need to consider how our future generation going to live in the planet if one day we really completely ruined it. People in developed country enjoying all the wealth that they have created with the development of technology and the use of natural resources, but at the same time many of us forget that we are sacrificing the sustainability we can live on the earth in exchange for wealth of country or individuals in a period of time. It is really time for us to think how we should stop causing more and more problems on global warming before it is too late.
</p><hr>

<p>
A single life time was all it took for us humans to ruin something good. It is crazy to think that future generations will have a tough time living on Earth due to it becoming uninhabitable. That the Earth my parents got to experience before me will also be different for the one that my kids will get to experience. I always knew that the US contributed a large percentage to the effects of climate change. I just did not know how big that number was. We are spoiled and are continuing to abuse from Earth. 
<br><br>
The lecture does a really good job showing the viewer that the decisions made by some adults affected their life now. How due to how these adults chose to live before and take advantage of these fossil fuels that is made the Earth what it is now. It also shows the viewer that that we are now also contributing to this crisis. That the decisions we make now will dictate the Earth we will give to our future generation.

</p><hr>

<p>
In both "The climate crisis as a generational issue" and "how the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime Hiltner really drives home the fact that the older generations have left a problem for us to fix, and that such a small population of the world has caused the most damage. 1/8th of the population of the WORLD has contributed to expelling nearly 67% of all CO2 in the atmosphere, thats an actual insane amount. And there's no one to blame, no excuses to be made for the blatant irresponsible consumption of our societies, and the worst part is, the majority doesn't seem concerned with changing that trend. It's truly sad to know that as 1st world countries we have contributed the most to climate change, yet we"ll be the least affected by it in the short run. 
<br><br>
 I also wonder if we had labels on fast fashion clothes, descriptions in restaurant menus, or as Savannah Crippen said "labels on gas pumps" that told the exact history and carbon footprint of those items, would people understand the true weight of the climate crisis and in some way alter their behavior to be more sustainable? Would they stare in horror at the reality of the effects of our consumption-based society? Or would they just accept it as is and further it's deadly progress?
</p><hr>

<p>
In "The climate crisis as a generational issue" and "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" lectures, the time delay aspect of the impact of excessive amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere is discussed. The impact of cigarette smoking is used as a helpful analogy that visualized the issue better for me. There was also the overwhelming use of and addiction to fossil fuels by developed countries that helped to bring about the climate crisis in a single lifetime. It was surprising and disappointing to learn that 3 billion people (nearly half of the population) in poorer parts of the world only contributed 5% of the CO2 in the atmosphere, while the U.S. accounted for a quarter of all the CO2. It is also disappointing to learn that much of our country's profits are owed to the use of fossil fuels, and subsequently, the killing of our planet.
<br><br>
Despite these details, I appreciate that there is greater awareness of the excess of CO2 in our atmosphere by my generation. Seeing the younger generation mobilize against the pollution and love of fossil fuels by those that preceded us is very encouraging. People are beginning to seek out and demand a more sustainable future. Despite the idea that the climate crisis's worst consequences may materialize during our lifetime,  it is great to see that steps are being taken to acknowledge its possibility and to ensure a safer future for future generations.

I do not dare to accept Ken’s apology, since my generation is doing exactly the same thing as Ken’s generation has done to our beloved planet. Through the lecture, we can see from Ken that the climate circumstance is getting worse each year, and in the nearest decades, the rate has increase even more faster. The most astonishing data is the disproportion between the greenhouse gas emission between developed countries and developing countries. The developed countries contribute for nearly two thirds of greenhouse gas emission, and the poorest 3 billion, which is nearly half of the global population, only account for 5% of greenhouse gas emission. This strong contrast in between brings me to ponder over the climate issue. If we don’t do something at once to stop or to slow down the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and so, we will leave our next and further generation into inevitable suffering in their whole lifetime, and that is what we don’t want to see. Hence, we can make a difference from now on to protect our globe in action.

<p>
In the last video " how the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime", professor Ken draws out a point which is how to live sustainably so that the earth is habitable for generations after generations. Within the development of this society, it has become extremely difficult to separate the use of fossil fuel. It is important to protect the environment, but human needs to develop, so to find new and green energy to replace fossil fuel is essential. But we still have a long way to go. Professor also mentioned that the Carbon Dioxide in the air has increased tremendously since the year he was born. We, as the newest generation who is merging to society, during our growth, we had personally experienced the change of the environment and the change of technology on improving the earth into a greener planet for humans to live in. 
<br><br>
What is good is that people are more aware of this climate issue, especially the youth. From the first video, the youth went on the streets and protest. It is important for people to be aware of this issue so that people can start to react immediately and effectively. Humans cannot be selfish anymore, not just think about our generation. The earth is a home for humans right now and possibly still for hundreds of years. One generation should protect and reduce the harm for the next generation, and then pass on to the generation afterward.

I was really shocked about the amount of carbon dioxide that has been released since the time of professor Ken's birth. It is just devastating especially since much of it has been trapped in the ocean as well and has lead to negative issues such as coral reef bleaching. And it is also disappointing that people who have very low footprints are impacted the most.
<br><br>
I agree that it is good that we are more aware of the issues, it could push us further to change our lifestyles and help us let other people be more aware as well. I also agree with you on the point you made about us still having a long way to go. Although we may be more aware of the issues, there are still some people who may not see the urgency of the actions needed to be made. Ken's apology really moved me. The part where he said that he will continue to fight on with us until his last breath really stood out to me, because I felt that it was very sincere.

The first lecture was about climate strikes in Santa Barbara and how the current generation is making a change through organizations such as the Sunrise movement. I personally found this to be inspiring because people choose to peacefully stand up for what they believe in rather than keeping silent about complicated, heated topics. Through watching this lecture, I was able to think more about the impacts of raising awareness and how that will impact others to also gain a consciousness for the environment.
<br><br>
The second lecture then transitions into the generational impacts of climate change detailing about carbon oxide levels. In this lecture, I thought it was really brilliant to use the analogy of cigarettes with long-term effects on the environment. There is just so much things that we are unable to predict in the future especially the consequences of human actions. I also immediately thought about the movie “The Lorax” where the guardian of the forest warns people not to cut down trees to only negatively result in the inhabitable aspects of nature when society decides to do it anyway due to greed. Upon thinking about the future, things sound very pessimistic especially in the trend that the world is going through as a whole with floods and rising statistics with CO2 levels just with the U.S. alone.
</p><hr>

<p>
I liked the analogy that compares smoking cigarettes to burning fossil fuels. It adequately illustrates how humans are affected by the actions and habits of previous generations. Not only are humans adversely affected, but so are all forms of life on Earth. 
<br><br>
It got a bad as it is today because people kept telling themselves there wasn’t much to worry about. They only thought this due to the significant time delay before the consequences were felt. Now we are really feeling the consequences in ways described in “Before the Flood.” For example, if the temperature continues to rise at a steady pace, the ice that makes up Greenland will melt, the water will get warmer, and the land will shrink even further. Coasts are also threatened by sea level rise. It’s crazy that these are the effects of decades of fossil fuel addiction.

</p><hr>

<p>
The actions of previous generations in developed nations have helped contribute to creating a planet that can become inhabitable. The youth movement has really taken off and is addressing the wrongdoings of those before them as their impact has affected life around the globe. The poorest three billion people in the world have only 5% of a contribution to carbon dioxide emissions which is really nothing, while the US has a whopping 25%. This shows a lot and lets me know what the problem is which is the behavior not the number of people. The effects not being immediate really helped make it easier to keep committing foul and ecologically unfriendly measures. It took only a single lifetime to really do some intense damage and that's disturbing, but as a result, there is a generational split among the population because older folks don't really see consequences since they don't see anything happening right in front of their faces if they live in the US. That's a lifestyle of privilege that's been given to them due to where they live as those who suffer are in poorer communities. The continuous use of fossil fuels increased ppm in the atmosphere and also resulted in acidifying the ocean, so our natural means of absorbing carbon dioxide is slowly dying off. There needs to be more done than an apology, there need to be new policies and more of a platform given to activists in this field so that there's still hope.
</p><hr>

<p>
It is extremely shocking that in the past years carbon emissions have been exponentially increasing at an alarming rate. It is releasing faster than we can comprehend, and faster than we can counter with our current measures to stop climate change. Unless we actually try to make major changes in our lifestyle and regulations to protect the environment, then we are going to be hurting the entire population, especially those who are not responsible for the majority of climate change. It is completely unfair how those in other developing countries have less of an impact on the Earth's climate, yet they will suffer the consequences the most. Therefore, it is our responsibility in America (and other developed countries) to make changes in this world. 
<br><br>
In regards to how the previous generations should be apologetic for their contribution to the carbon emissions, I disagree that they should be held accountable. No one at the time was aware that they were affecting the planet, as there was not enough information on it, and most of the population was just living their daily lives, similar to our generation today. The majority of the population, regardless of what generation they are from, is not responsible for the main percentage of carbon emissions released, and instead those in charge of large companies and those in power should be held accountable for their ongoing actions. One statistic that I saw was that the top 100 companies are responsible for 71% of released carbon emissions. As for our generation, we now have the information and are aware of the issue, thus we must make a change for upcoming generations.
</p><hr>

<p>
The previous mass extinctions’ carbon rise was a lot slower than the way we are seeing today, which is frightening. And on top of that, we are experiencing a huge delay that blurs the answer to the question, “Is it too late?” Were the 60s our last years to finally reduce the planets CO2 ppm levels? We shouldn’t be focusing on tobacco and all these issues when the wake of the climate crisis is at our front door! It sucks that the most developed worlds are hurting the planet the most. Is the U.S and Europe developed for the betterment of humanity? I don’t know how we would know. The video “climate crisis as a generational issue” was very insightful. I have noticed lately that the new generation is more vegan, drinking new milks, and adopting better climate-focused diets. When Ken mentions that we’re handing our new generation an uninhabitable planet, it’s a huge rude awakening at how unfair it is to allow solely older governmental officials decide on climate issues. Evidently, most younger people especially those on social media outlets (tik tok, twitter, etc) are being shifted into this mindset.
</p><hr>

<p>
First off, what a potent and attention-grabbing title. This is just what we need to get people's attention to the climate crisis!
<br><br>
I agree with Professor Hiltner's assertion that there is still time to act. While we are running out of time before hit the point of no return, we have a shot at slowing down and keeping control of our carbon emissions. This can only happen if everyone around the world makes a concerted effort to save our planet. A sense of urgency and action must be ingrained in everyone's minds for this to work. The time delay the professor describes is certainly a main factor of why the current state of the planet exists. Inaction, in addition to increased emissions, bred the climate crisis.
<br><br>
Professor Hiltner's talk about the new generation gives me hope--my generation and the generation after myself are more receptive than ever on issues affecting our planet. When we reach a so-called "changing of the guard" in government (when my generation takes up public office positions from older people), we will certainly start to see more radical change take place. We are already seeing noise being made from some freshman congresswomen such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. 
<br><br>
We must see the climate crisis as more than a generational issue. This affects everybody, everywhere.
</p><hr>

<p>
The analogy to the hypothetical delayed consequence of a "five pack a day" lifestyle is a fantastic way to depict the way it feels to become environmentally and politically aware in this era. The post-war economy's obsession with "stuff" has plummeted our planet into an irreversible spiral of catastrophe and accidents waiting to happen. The generation before mine, the people who give us the most support and have taught us to think the way we do about life, are the ones who have caused this; and those with the true political and financial power did so knowingly for the sake of their profit. The professionals of today aren't creating a safer environment for tomorrow, as they should be doing to prepare for generations to come- instead they are generating the opposite effect. Modern economic growth and globalization have instigated a monumental change to our planets comfortable climate and it is resulting in a domino effect of chaos. My generation, in an ultimate act of betrayal, is being left with the delayed consequence of a diseased planet and no one to take responsibility for it. 
<br><br>
Being raised in this era, however, it is obvious that this lifestyle is all we know. We may not be the cause of the problem, but every single one of us who takes advantage of our machines and appliances and technologies are contributing to it. Blind anger at those who put this upon us or playing the blame game is NOT what will solve this problem. Yet the majority of the publicity that the climate crisis receives is that which delineates the issues and explains their consequences or causes. It is understandable why that is so, as there is no true solution that has been decided. While it raises awareness, this strategy is wildly unhelpful. It needs to be emphasized to the everyday Joe how he can actually change the way he was raised. Articles outlining simple transitions for a more sustainable lifestyle, college courses and primary school topics teaching youth to train themselves to live differently than we were raised: this is what we need. This is, I feel, one of the most challenging obstacles to approach in this issue. Life before modern technologies is truthfully unimaginable, but that is the direction we much turn to instead of waiting for capitalism, and economic growth, and bickering politicians to solve the problem for us.

I agree with what you have said. When you mentioned, "...professionals of today aren't creating a safer environment for tomorrow..." I realized that this is disturbingly true and I believe that the denial of climate change from certain news stations and political figures is allowing for these professionals to get away with what they are doing. I believe that if more people in the United States were to know of the amount of CO2 we are producing even though we only make up 4% of the world's population, they would be disgusted and more willing to help change things for the better of our world. 
<br><br>
But you also brought up a good point which is that the newest generation of people on this planet are wanting to help but are accustomed to living in a society where we are adding to the problem. Due to increases in technology and population, especially in the United States, the newest generation can arguably be said to have created the most CO2 that will eventually be added into our atmosphere and raise the PPM. Our planet is heading on an uphill climb to being destroyed and causing its people and animals to suffer for what such a small amount of people have created.
<br><br>
I hope that soon our country can help to spread awareness about climate change and express how we can lessen our impact so that our children and grandchildren do not have to suffer more than they should. I agree with you and believe that educating the public through schools is what we need to do and if we started to educate our population from the start of elementary school, then we would be able to skip the step that we are struggling with a lot at the moment, which is lack of knowledge. As I stated in the beginning, if more people were to know the severity of our planet's situation, then we would have a better chance at really changing our systems to reduce our levels of CO2 being released.

In these lectures, Ken explains how climate change is the results of very recent history. The generations that precede ours have caused harm to the planet that my generation and those that follow must suffer through and attempt to fix. And, the wealth and power of the developed world, which was largely accumulated based on a destructive fossil fuel economy, will help protect us from the harm that much of the developed world has caused while those in developing countries will suffer the most. The injustice associated with this infuriates me because the most undeserving populations will have to pay for the selfish and destructive actions of powerful and wealthy people in the developed world. The fact that the people who helped contribute the most to climate change will see the least of the consequences is unfair to say the least, whether it's because they will die of old age before seeing the catastrophic effects, or because they didn't have the privilege of being born in a developed country. The fact that the people to be held accountable for this crisis are the same people with the power to impose aggressive climate action to curtail this crisis is very concerning to me, as it seems like there is no hope in solving this issue because said people profit from/gain power from the slow destruction of our world. For the world's sake, I hope I'm wrong about that.

<p>
In the “The Climate Crisis as a generational issue” and “How the Climate Crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” lectures indicate how previous generations contribute to climate change and how they are responsible for the consequences of emission of greenhouse gases. I agree with Ken that in decades people kept telling themselves climate change is “nothing to worry about”, even today’s society people still believe there is “no such a thing of greenhouse effect”. However, our generations will suffering from what we have done to the climate and to the Earth. There are many species already extinct and the ecology is facing more challenges. People might believe minor species extinct because they could not adapt but the truth is the rapid climate change leave limited time for them to adapt.

<p>
Dr. Hiltner’s lecture was very fascinating as well as very frightening. The fact that it has taken only 60 years to pollute the world to the extent that it has been polluted is mind boggling. As Ken said, it took from thousands upon thousands of years for the CO2 levels to rise 30 ppm and within these last 60 years it has risen another 100 ppm, this is, well, pitiful. Within one lifetime as Ken has said we have drove the planet to an ecological tipping point. It is a crisis that has been for the most part brought about by my grandparents and parents generations. What I couldn’t help but think about after watching this is, if this is how much global warming has escalated in 60 years, by the time I am 60 what is the world going to be like? It is an absolutely terrifying thought, a lot rides in the hands of my generation.  
<br><br>
What also struck me after watching the lecture was how must injustice that poorer countries are facing. The fact that they are responsible for 5% of carbon emissions and they are going to face the dangers and disasters prompted by climate change in the greatest degree is completley unacceptable and as an American I am embarrassed and sorry. They in no way deserve what is coming to them. I hope that the leaders of more developed and more wealthy countries realize this and send the proper aid.

<p>
For  the last part Prof. Hiltner said he felt sorry for their decades leaving us such "an uninhabited world" to live, it was touching my heart much. To be honest, we all know that our generation did "take a part in today's climate crisis", but i do want to say thank you for now teaching us, your students to know what our earth will be like in the future decades. I from the deep of my heart want to thank you for your hard work and i need to say even before i was taking this class or to say before i came to U.S, i  didn't worry that much about our planet or putting a little efforts for saving our planet. Since i am an international student. I lived in China for the past 19 yrs, later i came here for studying. Thanks for the experience to let me see how Americans do take a lot a lot of actions to take care of the environment. I know my country is a developing country. 
<br><br>
As what Ken mentioned in this video, "developed countries like Europe, the U.S, and Russia took almost 66.67% of CO2 emissions in the past few decades. However, i do realize China is developing so fast now and also was in the past 10 years. I lived in China my home country so i know we should be way more responsible for this present "uninhabitable earth". But i do want to say China's main cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, and etc are now taking real actions to be environmentally responsible and i am happy to see that our government are making significant changes and rules to punish the people who damage our environment. After watching this video, i more to believe that's why we should come to college, or thanks for my parents who raised me and gave me such a precious chance to study in U.S. After i came here, i have realized more and worried more about our environment when i witnessed how Americans care and protect their environment how Santa Barbara people working on protecting the ocean, the marine animals. I was touched now because i believe in the future decades, your students or people like us who are getting good education will greatly raise their awareness in protecting our planet and making it better for our future descendants. I swear. At last thank you for your amazing video and work!!
</p><hr>

<p>
I did not know that one generation of people was largely responsible for the climate crisis, and only a small portion of them at that.
</p><hr>

<p>
I connected with Ken's analogy likening cigarette smoking to climate change. The negative effects of both started to come to light around the same time, and while everyone is well aware of the harmful nature of cigarettes, climate change remains a largely obscure concept in the back of people's minds. It's funny how quick people are to boycott something that is realized to be bad for people on an immediate level, yet on a larger, lifestyle scale we still turn a blind eye. 
<br><br>
I think apathy is the biggest opponent to climate change movement, I wish every person could have Ken's perspective of one person's enjoyment affecting all future life on earth. We simply cannot continue living the way we are in the US, as proven by the startling pieces of data highlighted in this video.

</p><hr>

<p>
In this video, Ken offers a variety of facts that show how our dependence on fossil fuels has and will impact generations to come. It’s astounding that 3/4ths of CO2 in the atmosphere was put there in a single-lifetime. It almost seems impossible for us to do this, but it just goes to show how much we actually consume, and how extreme our consumption actually is in developed countries. It is unfair that future generations must suffer the consequences; and perhaps even worse, we really have no way of knowing exactly what will happen and when. We can prepare all we want, but who knows if we are actually preparing in the right ways. As Ken notes, there is a time delay for these consequences, and while I’m sure scientists can offer many perspectives on what will happen and when, everything seems rather unpredictable. Every scenario should be considered in the event things happen differently than what is projected as of today.
</p><hr>

<p>
The lecture videos "The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue" and "How the Climate Crisis Was Brought About in a Single Lifetime" made by Ken simply expresses, as well as, showcases the fact that climate crisis began due to past generations. Due to the sad fact that this generation, as well as, the future generations being left with the abused planet, it is extremely crucial to learn from past generation's mistakes and simply help the planet now instead of abusing it by living sustainably. Showcased in "The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue" many individuals simply go on strike to make it known that our planet needs everyone's help in order to make a change for an optimistic future. In both lecture videos, Ken expresses the sad truth about the past generations not taking care of our planet as it should be. It was very respectful of Ken to take upon the blame for past generations, simply due to the fact that many do not own up to their actions, especially when wrong. With the known fact of our planet being the way it is today because of past generations, it is our generation's- as well as the future generations- to take charge and make a change. Simply learn from past generation's mistakes of abusing the planet to simply help the planet. The strikers of our generation that are- in Ken's words- "rebelling" are simply inspirational due to showing that there are individuals that are upset with the condition of our planet and believe in helping and making a change to optimize our future. Debriefing the two lecture videos, the cruciality of learning from past generation's mistakes is massive in order to help reduce the negative impacts of climate change.

As professor Hiltner mentioned in class and the video, today’s developed countries should take the count of most of the CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. However, as the environment getting damaged, the countries that suffer the most from the environmental crisis are those poor, developing countries. Also, wealthy people emit way more CO2 than those poor people who are actually suffering the most from the worsened environment. This is ironic and unfair. Furthermore, younger generations take the count of what their father or grandfather did to the environment, as professor said in the video, his generation should apologize and be shamed by what they did to the earth. I have never thought about this before: the damages are brought by one generation who’s still damaging the planet. I noticed an important point is that professor mentioned even in the younger generation, there are still many people living in a resource-wasting lifestyle. I would say this is very true because I’ve seen people wasting water, food, paper, etc. in my daily life. If we keep doing this, our planet will definitely be damaged faster than we thought.

</p><hr>

<p>
I appreciate Ken for openly saying that the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime, his lifetime. I feel like there are not many adults that will apologize for their wrongdoings and still use their voice to make change. Many adults choose to ignore the climate crisis and global warming because they will not be here to see the monstrosity that will result from it. The metaphor that Ken made comparing smoking cigarettes with no consequence to adults living carbon-filled lifestyles is very accurate. Adults are still smoking cigarettes with no consequences. 
<br><br>
I felt frustration and shock when I found out that the poorest 3 billion people on Earth contribute only 5% of the CO2 emissions while Americans contribute a quarter of the CO2 emissions. When did the situation get this out of hand? I feel selfish as an American knowing that my CO2 emissions are exponentially greater than others in underdeveloped countries. At the end of the day, we all breathe the same air regardless of our varying carbon footprints.
<br><br>
Before this video, I felt like my generation was entirely responsible for fixing our broken Earth that was passed onto us. Now that I have watched Ken’s lecture video, I feel more confident that there are more adults on our side fighting global warming. A solution exists and it is not too late to act. However, we need all generations to work together.
</p><hr>

<p>
It surprises me how the killing of our planet has occurred in such an abrupt time spam. To know that three fourths of all carbon emissions occurred in a single human lifetime is simply mind boggling. And, paired with the fact that it takes hundreds of years for greenhouse gases to leave the atmosphere, the crisis seems even more impossible. Addressing climate change from a social standpoint, you can see how we as a people conveniently avoided addressing this important issue. Humans from all over reap the benefits of detrimental innovation, and only a small percentage are taking action against climate change. Though, in earlier times, it’s realistic to believe that no one was looking far enough to realize that the effects of mass deforestation and industrialization would backfire, society for some time now has been advanced enough to recognize this problem. It’s astounding to know that the time delay between our actions and the changing of the climate was the period where humans decided to increase their carbon footprint, and how polluting is ingrained into our everyday routines. It’s unbelievable to hear that this benefit of the first world: ruining the world and leaving the poorest countries to face the problem. Thankfully, the delayed acknowledgement of this environmental crime has given rise to a distinct generation of environmental activists. The analogy of cigarette smoking really clarifies the absurdity of anthropogenic climate change. This video effectively explains how it’s a massive ripple effect that ends with no winners.
</p><hr>

<p>
In response to the video lecture beforehand, it is true that power does lie in the youth movement as it reflects that each generation is taking part in the fight against climate change and that ignorance shall not take over. Rather than focusing blame on a specific group or generation, we must address the problem directly. I admit that the radical steps towards taking change will be hard for myself as such solutions require all people to change their lifestyles; However, it may be all they have ever known and can’t simply break away from their way of living. With understanding and lack of misguidance, we must acknowledge this call to action as Ken as presented to us rather than allowing our peers and the rest of the world fall victim to these consequences.
<br><br>
I greatly appreciated the analogy of the generational contribution and cause of climate change to the smoking of cigarettes as it helped me visualize the resulting consequences placed on further generations. The sheer increase from PPM over the years holds devastating effects to our environment that contributors may not have recognized in the meantime, which is why it is as important as ever that those who acknowledge the effect that carbon emissions have on our atmosphere now must take the steps to reduce and eliminate it. The fact that one-eight of the world’s population is responsible for 66% of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere demonstrates an immoral position held that affects the entire world and especially devastates poorer countries. This angered me as I realized how many people fail to look outside their own perspective and consider the lives of other people. Especially for something on such a large scale as this, the global impact it has endangers the lives of other humans and animals. It makes me wonder how those in the position of power within these oil and fuel corporations respond to this and while politicians may not choose to stand against them.
</p><hr>


<p>
Both “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” and “The climate crisis as a generational issue”  highlight one of the most frustrating and worrisome aspects of the climate crisis: a majority of people in the older generation who caused this crisis don’t believe it was their fault and/or don’t care how it will affect the future and future generations. This apathetic view of the climate crisis is not only disheartening but is also baffling, in my opinion. There are countless obvious signs that the effects of anthropogenic climate change are already upon us, yet many boomers turn a blind eye to record droughts and rising sea levels, instead choosing to taunt younger people for being such “sensitive snowflakes”. I’m sorry but I’m not the one who throws a hissy fit if someone suggests a slight change to my environmentally destructive behavior, so do we really want to talk about who’s sensitive here? Clearly not every person above the age of 45 has this passive view of climate change just as every young person isn’t an environmental hero, Professor Hiltner himself being a great example of someone who cares as much about the environment as Greta Thunberg herself! The apology from Professor Hiltner was, in my opinion, very meaningful and refreshing, as we don’t see this repentance of the previous generations represented much in the media. 
<br><br>
One of my favorite parts of all the material from both videos was the comparison between smoking cigarettes and climate change. I thought that this comparison was a great way to help the viewers understand how something as destructive as the climate crisis could have come about in a single generation. The cigarette example also emphasized the importance of the lag in the effects of climate change and how this lag has allowed people to believe that their actions aren’t affecting the climate like many scientists say they are. Although it can be disheartening to know that many older people won’t accept that the climate crisis is here, there are so many young people who are incredibly passionate about protecting the earth and their voices trump the voices of any naysayers and climate deniers.
</p><hr>

<p>
I find it astonishing how the United States is responsible for a quarter of all CO2 emissions even though it only accounts for 1/4 of the world population. It is extremely unfair how the poorest people in the world are the ones contributing the least to the climate crisis, yet will undoubtedly be the ones most affected. It is also unbelievable how the richest countries are so shortsighted that they continue business as usual for short-term economic gain when the long-term effects of their actions will be catastrophic. As Ken said, the consequences of what one in eight people do regarding climate change in one generation will affect the 12 following generations.
<br><br>
It is also disheartening to realize that many people are complacent now even though the earlier the crisis is addressed, the less dire it will be. I do, however, believe that it is not the fault of many of these individuals as there is a lot of misinformation being spread about the climate crisis. Instead, it should be the companies and politicians that support these disinformation campaigns as well as advocate for less action on climate change apologizing rather than a professor trying to educate people about the crisis.
</p><hr>

<p>
In the video “The climate crisis as a generational issue,” Ken raised an intriguing point that climate problem is a long-lasting issue which will still exist through generations even though the actions are taken now. In other words, the things people did to harm the environment is going to have an effect on their children. Also, in the second video, Ken’s discussion about justice arouses my interests. Actually, wealthier countries contribute to climate change far more by emitting greenhouse. As a consequence, poor people would suffer a lot while they are not the major victim of  climate crisis.
</p><hr>

<p>
Professor Hiltner shouldn't be the one that apologizes for the climate crisis. While what he says about climate change being a generational issue is true, it is not his fault that the issue has grown in magnitude to be the problem that it is today. Instead, I believe the  blame lies on the individuals who have turned a blind eye to climate change. I find it depressing that Professor Hiltner feels partially responsible for the exacerbation of the climate crisis. The ones who should be apologizing are those that are in positions of power who continuously question the validity of climate change and obstruct any attempts to resolve it. Despite this, I do not believe that assigning blame and issuing apologies provides any meaningful solution to the problem at hand. We should be looking to provide solutions, educate people, and promote activism. 
<br><br>
The smoking analogy that Professor Hiltner makes is entirely appropriate. In many ways, that is exactly what is happening to our present day society, and the fact that people in other countries who have had next to no impact on climate change will be the ones who will be challenged by it the most is probably the most tragic injustice of not only this generation but of the rest that follow. The lives of these people and the subsequent lives of their descendants will be changed in ways that are impossible to fathom. In many ways, climate change and the disasters that follow it are in some ways a form of mass genocide in which the poorest among us will suffer the most. I don't want to be the one who has to make this point but this is the current issue that we are facing and it is a reflection of the current track we are set on. It's terrible to think about, but it is the truth and it must be acknowledged
</p><hr>

<p>
I can't even believe that we have contributed a large amount of carbon emissions while the poorest 3 billion people just have contributed 5%, because there are just 7.75 billion people in the world. That means nearly a half population of the world are suffering from the consequence which they shouldn't suffer. They did neither enjoy the way we live nor contribute too much to the carbon emissions. It's unfair to let them afford worse consequence than us. People never pay attention to the problems until the problems are out of control, which is so dangerous. People have to take actions immediately about the climate change.
</p><hr>

<p>
The youth rebellion has to fix what our past generations failed to do so. CO2 emissions have been known to be increasing exponentially decades ago. I am disgusted by this,  our future generations born in the next one hundred years will suffer.  The analogy Ken makes about cigarette smoking cannot be more morally righteous. If one would to smoke for a whole lifetime without any ramifications and then irresponsibly leave the health problems so your children can have them would be cruel. Let that sink in, this is the current problem we are facing at the moment.  Not only our humans this generation being impacted but also marine and insect life. The U.S, Russia and Europe contribute to two-thirds of carbon dioxide emissions while the poorest 3 billion people in the world contributed an insignificant 5% in their lifetime.  I really appreciate Ken for having the honesty and courage to apologize for the mistakes and negligence his generation had. Certainly,  if our generation wants to prevent the Earth from becoming uninhabitable, we need support from our past generation. 
<br><br>
The main goal right now is to be able to spread awareness across a platform. I strongly believe social media can be a major turning point. If we can somehow let people know through their phones, laptops or tablets that we must all stand together to stop any further climate ramifications. I for one am going to start donating to environmentalist charities and posting climate change information posts on my Instagram stories to let my audience be influenced for a change. United we stand, divided we fall. We still have time to reverse this.
</p><hr>

<p>
It is saddening to accept the fact that our parents, grandparent, and the majority of prior generations have turned their heads when prompted to take action to combat anthropogenic climate change. One striking statistic that Ken noted within this video is that 3/4 of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere was put there during a single lifetime and by the generations that have come before us college students. I find it difficult to think about this statistic when our current generation is participating in many of the same practices as our previous generations; therefore, putting us on the same detrimental track. Our generation has become inspired to act in opposition to the climate crisis and during this course I look forward to learning about new solutions and action we can take to further combat the issues at hand. I hope that with the knowledge that is available to current generations, that we are able to create an effective framework of action for future generations instead of turning a blind eye.
</p><hr>

<p>
I have definitely spent time in the past thinking about how climate change is a generational issue. I do think it is unfortunate/unfair that the actions of past generations can so heavily impact young people today and generations to come. However, I believe there is a bit of a double-edged sword when it comes to the actions of the past generations. It is true that the consumptive lifestyle and fossil fuel burning of industrial societies has contributed to climate change. However, with these actions came economic progress and improved quality of life. I think it is a bit naive to simply attack the past generation for their actions/inaction on climate. Would you rather be a college student in America or a poor rice farmer in India? The industrial nature of America and the dumb luck of being born here has lead us to this point in our lives, and we fortunate to live the lives we do. We have to face the fact that our comfortable lives come at an enormous cost to the planet. Unfortunately, I do not think this awareness of the impact everyday actions have on the environment existed until recently, but I feel like everybody has an inherent sense of what is good or bad for the environment. I think re-developing people's connection to nature through outreach and education can inspire a change in habits and lifestyle choices. However, individuals can only do so much when they are trapped in a system that relies on practices that are damaging to the environment. People need to work, eat, and travel to live in modern society. It is asking a lot for people to stop driving, grocery shopping, flying, etc when that is the only way to operate in society today. I think real change needs to come from the top down, but motivated by the people. Hopefully movements and elections can change the system in ways that can then allow people to make conscious choices more easily.
</p><hr>

<p>
I found Ken's idea of delaying effect is very appealing. Thinking carefully, we are currently at the stage of the delaying effect. The climate has already suffered from the negative human activities for decades. Since most of us are not affected by the climate changes, we are still breathing normally, people barely realized the down side of the human activities. If we do not consider the consequence, we will just keep doing what we have done. Like smoking, it was popular. People keep smoking, but at one instance lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases spread and affect people's life spans. At that particular moment, people learned that smoking is bad and they quit. However, at this very special time, the negative side effects of human activities are not widespread enough to wake people up.
<br><br>
It is true that many species disappeared and the carbon dioxide level increased, but people were not directly affected. As our nation develops, it is reasonable that more CO2 is released. However, it is not reasonable to keep doing that, after knowing the consequences. Therefore, as we advance the technology, we need to find ways to reduce the consumption of energies like fossil fuel, but use more clean energies. It is not only the scientists' responsibilities, but also every single person on the planet to take actions.
</p><hr>

<p>
I deeply admire the role that Ken has taken as a voice of his generation to apologize to younger generations of today. It is seldom that someone voluntarily takes the weight of destruction on their back to apologize for the damage done by more than themselves. During the first lecture, when Ken first mentioned that this dismantling of the health of the planet has happened in such an exponential fashion, I was taken aback. Even more so when in his video lecture he mentions that he is confident that there is a solution. I can’t lie when I say that his statement struck more anxiety in me than hope. I do want to believe it, I do! Where my confusion comes into play is how we will get the time to act quick enough to reverse such quick effects. And these effects are worsening as we speak, as Ken says we only physically see the effects after some time has elapsed. I feel an incredible amount of guilt while I sit here thinking about how many times in my life I have contributed to climate change. Every time I drive my car, waste food, throw away a one-use plastic fork. How much water have I used? How many Starbucks coffee cups have I tossed in a landfill trash cans? Have I accidentally littered? It seems impossible to think about my impact all day, every day, but it WANT to. I WANT to. It inspires me to read more articles on waste reduction and guidebooks to an eco-conscious life in hopes that I can spread the word to my social circles.
<br><br>
I am family-oriented and have wanted to have my own children for as long as I can remember. I can’t lie when I say I am a bit scared when I imagine what our world will look like by then. I can definitely say that my eco-conscious lifestyle would be reflected and passed down to my kids in hope that that’d also encourage others to be conscious of their decisions and impacts.

Your comment made me reflect on how large my carbon footprint is as an American consumer and it really is quite astounding how much of an impact we make as individuals. Like you said, it does seem impossible to think about your carbon footprint all day everyday, however I believe small habits of awareness will breed substantial patterns in our daily lives. If everyone focuses on being a bit more conscious of their impact and takes moderate but meaningful steps in reducing it, it will have far-reaching effects. I agree with your sentiment about wanting to set a good, eco-conscious example for the generations after you because whatever work we start now in helping to save our planet, they must carry on after us. It is crucial for us to find long term solutions for the climate crisis and teaching our children eco-friendly lifestyles is definitely part of that solution. Ken and many others from the generation before us are  regretting their lack of action when this situation was less dire. We have to take the action they never did and we cannot be part of a generation who passes their problems onto the next.

It is incredibly infuriating to be part of a generation trying to solve an urgent issue such as climate change, caused by previous generations, while being constantly questioned and patronized about the movement by the people who contributed heavily to the problem. Even further, it is difficult to be unable to vote to fix the dangerous policies that perpetuate climate change, but only be able to watch as older generations vote to keep the same policies, when it will ultimately never affect them. 
<br><br>
It is abhorrent that a generation of people can cause so much damage and still fail to see where they went wrong, and continue to act to preserve dangerous fossil fuel practices and lead unsustainable lifestyles. I feel like I remember when recycling became a huge movement, and while it really is no work at all to separate garbage, I find that my grandparents (and even parents at times) still disregard it and think it is "not worth their time". It is hard to see the actions that ultimately will destroy us being repeated at leisure every day. I constantly find litter everywhere I go, even finding empty aluminum cans and food wrappers placed in the bushes at preserved botanical gardens. It is sickening to know that there are simple lifestyle changes that can be made easily, but are still being resisted because people "don't like change", and because it "was fine that way before". 
<br><br>
I also feel as though climate change is in part a class issue as well. The elite class constantly flies private jets, contributes massively to carbon emissions to fuel construction and practices material, unsustainable lifestyles, but then acts as the working class is a major part of the problem. In all realities, me bringing my own bags to the store and trying to carpool will not reduce carbon emissions as much as not flying a private jet. I am tired of seeing celebrities post about the effects of global warming as though they are heartbroken, but then continue to contribute mass amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Solving the issue of climate change is about drastically changing lifestyles, and I feel as though as the movement lives on, our voices amplify, and as politicians who care about this issue are elected, the importance of solving climate change will be hard to ignore.

On the voting, something that sticks out to me about this issue is the voter turnout of younger vs older voters in the US. Thanks to organizations like AARP, old voters are incredibly effective, organized voting bloc. Younger voters lack these sorts of connections, and they are of course new to voting entirely. More pressing, however, is the continuation of voter suppression under the guise of 'voter fraud'. Conveniently for older, conservative voters, the ones who get affected the most by these policies are those with opposing political views: the young and first generation immigrants. It's a system that perpetuates itself much like the entire fossil fuel economy we currently live in. That is the unfortunate thing about the climate crisis as a generational issue, that the 'generation in power', as it were, clutches onto every last material pleasure they can reap before they pass, knowing they will never have to consider the consequences themselves. 
<br><br>
It's the logical progression of neoliberalism and unregulated capitalism. Waste is virtually never a consideration to this day since it comes after the production of goods, it can be put off for someone else to take the burden. That's also where I think you make a great point, about how despite large movements to reduce waste, it persists. So many things are individually packed in plastic now, it all goes so much further than mere straws. 
<br><br>
Continuing on the progression of capitalism, it has inevitably led to an extreme level of income inequality that has made climate change such a class-based issue. It allows the elite to consume so much more, and in ways that are more devastating than if the same money was in the hands of many other people. Construction, as you noted, is a big one, and it's particularly notable since we're at a large research university, and of chief importance to any university is to endlessly build off the donations of the extremely rich. It's time for the elite to put their money where their mouth is in regards to an issue as pressing as climate change.

It is frustrating and saddening to see how the generation before us were so careless with our futures. Part of me wants to use my energy being angry about it, but on the other hand it is important to remember that our generation has the power to do the same to our children as our parents did to us. It makes me feel small living in a time that has so quickly brought the destruction of our planet, almost knowingly. But at the same time, videos like this one give me hope that we can be smart enough and compassionate enough to take action.
</p><hr>

<p>
The lecture mainly wants to illustrate that one generation’s action can influence the whole future generation on the planet. And the professor apologizes to new generation for the negative environmental influence of his generation.
<br><br>
I don’t think the old generation needs to apologize to us. Without a doubt, the old generation does somehow negatively influence the environment, but we should also think of their contribution. The cars, TV, mobile device, etc. are all the brilliant works that facilitate our life. It just follows the rule of equivalent exchange. The environment and the technology are conflicts to some extent. The old generation uses the environment to exchange rapid development in high-tech. In another way of thinking, the old generation invests our new generation. They let us bear in a high-tech based world and have the ability to explore the whole world. Therefore, as a part of the new generation, I think the old generation did a great job, and it is the time for us, the new generation, to take the responsibility in solving the environmental problem, regurgitation-feeding the planet with advanced technology. 
<br><br>
However, I think some powerful countries do own an apology to those less developed countries. From the pie chart in the lecture, we can see that the majority of carbon emission is from those highly developed countries. So, those countries should take most of the responsibility to fix the environment. The good news is there are some developed countries paying attention to the climate crisis, but it is not enough. We still need more people acting, especially the governments since they are the most influential to the people.

The video, “The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue,” is able to build the understanding of the effects of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the anthropogenic effect on the climate crisis. In delivering both facts and examples to explain the human role in causing the climate crisis, I was able to develop an understanding of some of the concepts. For instance, with the example of smoking. It is important to learn from the example that was addressed, that when smoking, an individual does not immediately experience a negative impact, but rather that impact can be seen in future generations in children and then grandchildren, that ultimately affects other species and leads toward death. What led me toward understanding, is how this was connected to the idea of a fossil fuel economy that is leading the climate crisis by just a small group of individuals, but ultimately impacts the whole globe as we have seen to this day. 
<br><br>
Moreover, with looking at the facts addressed, I felt that it was important to pay close attention to the topic of the growth of CO2 in the atmosphere, the greenhouse gas which has always been around and is one of the main contributors to the climate crisis. In discussing the year 1959 with CO2 at 315 ppm and today rising to be about 415 ppm in 2019, I found it interesting that the year 1959 was emphasized. This being said, it provides us with a chronological view of the past 60 years and the way the climate crisis fits. These facts among others are essential in understanding the impact of CO2 that is released in the atmosphere, that began in the past and continues to take place. Furthermore, these facts and comparisons led me to question what will the future of the climate crisis be like in the next decades?
</p><hr>

<p>
The professor has done a great job of attracting the emotions of people who have caused damage to the planet. He called for a bigger and more distant vision: The destruction of the planet today, such as the release of carbon dioxide, will cause suffering for all children for hundreds of years. When I heard that only 4% of the earths population (us) has contributed such a 25% of carbon emissions but the poorest  3 billion （42%）have contributed only 5% I was disgusted. we should do something. we(US) are benefit from using these resources but we did not pay all the cost of using them. we ask the 7 billion people and next generations to pay the cost together. while we are the only one who share the benefit. it is unfair for all 7 billion people and our children. If we emit 1 kilogram of carbon dioxide, we can bring about 200 yuan of short-term economic benefits, and it will cost 100 $ or more to completely eliminate 1 kilogram of carbon dioxide. We must charge these people for the emissions. We need to emit greenhouse gases in the most efficient way, instead of thinking about our immediate interests and not responsible for the future. I feel that people will not understand the danger until it is staring them right in the face. and the U.S. government will not give up the benefit from emit greenhouse gases while we do not pay all the cost.

The generational aspect of climate change is a very troubling one. It is very obvious that my generation was not responsible for climate change, however, at this point, we have been, like you stated in the video, normalized to this behavior and now treat our planet with abuse without even thinking about it. That is one of the things I thought should have been talked about more. Yes, our generation didn't start it, and yes, our generation is the prominent one working towards stopping this crisis, yet many of us are ignorant to subtle ways we hurt the Earth. The torch has been passed down from the generation above us and now, we are stuck in an abuse cycle that many don't even realize we are in. This is a very important issue that should be discussed more. While it is completely fair to blame the older generation for starting this issue, we must also blame ourselves for not taking more steps to break out of this cycle.
<br><br>
In addition, it is really disheartening to hear how just 1/8th of the human population was responsible for 2/3 of all the CO2 in the atmosphere, and that the United States made up a quarter of all the CO2 with just 4% of the population. As the most powerful country in the world, you would think we would have the ability to be the LEAST polluting country. It is absolutely shocking that this information is not more public, because everyone should know this. The poorest countries in the world barely contribute to climate change, and are the ones affected the most. This is not right.
<br><br>
These facts makes me want to participate more in politics in order to support deals that would make the United States one of the lesser polluting countries, because if the United States can pollute 25% of the CO2, then even JUST the United States cutting back will make a BIG difference.

<p>
What is quite interesting about both of Ken's lecture videos is this deeper and overarching picture of this corruption that engulfed his very own generation, the baby boomers, from being environmentally aware of their own actions they were leaving on the very Earth. After the ravages and great strife left behind the second world war, came out the baby boomers generation who grew up during a period of increasing affluence due in part to widespread post-war government subsidies in housing and education  like no other generation before them, and as many would call it, "the special generation". It was a generational period of great privilege and lifestyle change as ever expanding economies lead to rampant consumerism as the standard of living sky rocketed. Yet, this very privilege placed upon them is what corrupted them, through new joyous lifestyles and better standard of living, many of them lost sight of their carbon footprint being left behind by their own excessive consumerism, especially here in the United States where the second world war was a major economy boost. This corruption or blindness is what resulted in the major CO2 rise we see Ken point at through his year of birth, 1959, where it was around 315 ppm, till now in 2019 where it has risen to 415 ppm through his own life. 
<br><br>
Yet, it is very sad seeing that Ken is one of the very few of his own generation that has become environmental aware of what  his generation has left for our own generation, especially among the grief he wears upon his face when saying that he deeply sorry for what his generation has bestowed upon ours. 
<br><br>
Yet, even with such damages placed on our Earth, Ken still sees a possibility of our generation pulling through and fighting the climate change epidemic. Taking the knowledge of those from our past who have become knowledgeable in the fields of climate change, like Ken himself, we can make our selves more well rounded as problem solvers and see resolutions to such a disastrous epidemic. Knowledge will be the key in our future strife against the climate change epidemic as in our time now, major businesses like the oil industry have a overwhelming sway on the higher ups of our nation and through the gathering and building of knowledge can the truth ever become so apparent. 
<br><br>
Through the use of visual imagery and analogies, the films themselves are quite moving and almost in a way deeper sense of unease, knowing that our generation may in turn be the last line in defense before our planet becomes the Uninhabitable Earth as Wallace-Wells feared about. One in particular, the analogy of the smoker makes you think more about your actions having consequences as for the fact that you know what you do will have a ever lasting affect on the generation after us, but not only the generations from here forward, even our future families. Seeing now that our generation takes to the streets with our rage over the past generations inability to react to the climate change is a major step in the right direction and a direction that will only ever grow more as time comes along and more join the growing cause. As change in itself, has to begin with us, the students, to spread to the world all around us, wherever we are or are from.

<p>
In the first video, "The Climate crisis as a generational issue", it made me proud to see that a portion of my generation is fighting for a sustainable environment in the current climate crisis. However, I know there is still a lot of work to be done by my generation, including educating older and future generations about the destruction that climate change has caused and is causing. Although the burden of climate change was put directly on our generation by past generations, it is important that we actually make these sustainable choices in order to change the course that climate change is taking us towards. 
<br><br>
In the second video, I resonated with the cigarette analogy. I understand why past generations moved past the negative consequences of global warming because they, themselves would not be greatly effected by the repercussions. The United States is an individualistic society that focuses on the "individual" and doing what's necessary for the individual to advance in society. I believe this is one of the reasons why the United States is one the greatest contributors to climate change. Initially, fossil fuels sounded great because it was a type of advanced technology that was used for energy. Older generations either ignored or did not take into account the impact it would have on future generations. Their focus was how it would advance society in the current state that it was in. It is important to inform people about the consequences that the poorest countries will suffer the most from due to the impact of the United States and Europe's greenhouse emissions.

I agree with you in the fact that older generations take less interest in saving the planet because it will not effect them in the long run. Younger generations, in fact, have been advocating for laws regarding the subject to change and for our leaders to do something about it. Yes, we are slowly making a difference by fighting against climate change, but it is necessary for our generation to collectively change the mistakes of our predecessors. However, one cannot blame the entirety of the older generations, because many of their members, like Professor Hiltner, have noticed the issues they created and are advocating with us for change.
</span>
 </div><hr>

<p>
Both lectures discuss the environmental impacts that the previous generations were responsible for and how the effects are seen to this day. The idea of perspective is important because the time span you discuss is so small just in scale of human history and then considering geologic time, the matter seems much more severe. We are all are accountable for our actions and the environmental effects we have on our local ecosystems. With more exposure to screens and different kinds of media, developed countries are able to watch and understand our ecological impacts but what will inspire us to change? How can we convince entire countries to come together to accomplish a common goal? Will we show others how to change in order to fix this planet? Only time will tell.
</p><hr>

<p>
The climate crisis being brought about in a single lifetime is greatly terrifying because repairing the long-term effects brought on by it will take many more lifetimes to fix the damage done by earlier generations.  As a member of the generation to receive an earth that may soon no longer be habitable, I find it very frustrating that many people of the older generations will not take responsibility for their part played in destroying our planet, some still even being in denial about the existence of an issue.  I can appreciate the enthusiasm my generation has for protesting the negative effects of climate change, but more action must be taken by the individual to reduce the development of the climate crisis.  Even the things we may overlook on a daily basis, like a plant-based diet, opting out of purchasing from fast fashion corporations, and choosing greener means for transportation.  We cannot make the same mistakes as other generations, for the people of the new generation who have to the opportunity to simply see this planet continue, we should want to see our environment thrive. Preserve and protect our home not just for ourselves, but future generations as well.

<p>
The way Ken explained how the climate crisis was brought about really resonated with me. Especially when he expressed how at the time there are few consequences of an increasing climate crisis present due to a time delay, but this doesn't mean it isn't happening! As unfortunate as it is, many individuals have a mindset where if something doesn't directly affect them, then it isn't happening at all. Certainly ignorance is bliss, but at this point individuals who don't believe in climate change are choosing ignorance to enjoy bliss. In addition, I appreciate Ken's ability to parallel the climate crisis in an analogy that stresses the spike of the climate crisis in a comprehensible way. The smoking analogy effectively describes Ken's point of a time delay and few consequences in the beginning. 
<br><br>
I do also want to bring up another point that came to me while watching Ken's lectures. Old habits die hard, which is extremely frustrating for individuals/generations who demand for change of these terrible habits we have so deeply integrated into life. However younger generations must come to understand that growing up, many climate issues we see today weren't prevalent among the older generations. Especially with globalization and the help of the internet/media, the young generations of today are far more knowledgable of what is actually happening to our planet. Generational gaps and differences are very real and it's a tough situation to navigate. How do we change the way these older generations have been thinking for decades in an effectively manner?
</p><hr>

<p>
There are two main ideas that bring me hope from the topics discussed in this lecture. The first stemming from that since the baby boomer generation have been the generation to principally cause climate change, people coming to maturity now are more aware and care more about climate change than any generation before. This means that as this generation grows more into prominence, they will both tackle the issue and teach subsequent generations to more than any generation before. The second point is that because the effects of putting CO2 into the atmosphere have been so delayed (which is what allowed this situation to become so bad) those effects will now be felt with increasing severity, then the delayed effects will then cause people to rapidly care more about the issue than before when the effects were waiting.
</p><hr>

<p>
“The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” both accurately sum up the issue our generation faces. I think Ken did a good job summarizing the science and the social science aspects of climate change. I think one of the biggest reasons why climate change has become this generations issue aside from the fact that we are beginning to feel the effects of global rising temperatures, is media. Younger people have grown up in a digital age, which has granted them a unique connection with everyone around the world, which may have induced the feeling that we are all responsible for one another. Though that may be a stretch, it has definitely granted us the ability to see first hand how people is Australia are suffering because of fires, and the famine in Yemen. Sadly, Ken’s apology does not change the fact that even though we may be protesting, those in the US who have the power to take legislative action are primarily old white men, many of them with special interest in oil industries and a lack of interest in anything related to climate change.

Doesn't it feel like a big slap in the face? I was born, thankfully, but in this type of world, sadly. I agree how media can bring people together through this climate crisis and how it brings more awareness. Unfortunately, I am concerned about the slacktivism that comes with it. I despise how the saying "can't teach an old dog new tricks" is sometimes correct and it makes me want to give up because these "old dogs" happen to be the ones in charge! I would love to imagine sustainable living but, as I have been complaining about in other comments, I come from a very pessimistic view point of hopelessness and I don't see humanity getting itself together. It is extremely true that not everyone needed to do it for everyone to suffer. It still boggles my mind how some of these people have children but are still doing exactly what they were doing before. The youth are angry, as we should be.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree that growing up in a digital age may be a reason why it is easier for younger people to understand the affects that climate change has in the world and has made us feel more accountable for each other. Both lectures describe the impacts that have been created within generations that have led us to where we are today. Like you mentioned, the people in power tend to be primarily older men, and unfortunately they carry a capitalistic agenda that continues to leads us to failure. It seems that although younger generations may understand the impacts of climate change, we do not have the power to make those changes and the people in control are the same people who created this issue. Both lectures made me feel a little discouraged, but at the same time glad that I'm fully learning all of this information that I can use to make a change in the way I live my life and try to help the climate crisis movement in any way possible along with much of our generation, as we learn to navigate the modern world around us.
<br><br><hr><br>
I have to agree with you. The power of social media definitely has a huge impact on the knowledge of the people growing up in this digital age. In this way, like you said, we are granted this bond between one another and thus a certain responsibility to one another that we owe each other safety. We can see disasters all over the world, ranging from our very own home all the way to the fires in Australia. Ken's apology is accepted, but that does not change the fact that one apology cannot alter the course of our future that has been brewing within generations. The heads of our future mainly rely on a capitalistic agenda and thus do not see climate change as the largest of their issues. However, the movement for climate change continues to grow and the voices continue to grow as well. While the authority right now does not heed for a greener world necessarily, that does not mean that the future is bleak once this generation is able to achieve those powers and positions. Right now, all we can do are the little things and hopefully it'll all add up to something greater.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree that the media has a big influence on our generation. It does help us stay connected with those around the world as well as keeping us updated on the latest tragedies caused by climate change which definitely makes our generation more inclined to take action. I really appreciate that Luna brought up the fact that the people who have the power to actually make changes in office that would help our planet will not because they are (essentially) the ones who are investing in the industries that are causing the climate change in the first place. Until those "old white men" are out of office we are pretty much screwed. These men have been investing in these industries for years upon years. They are completely naive about the fact that climate change is real and is currently happening. It is hard to remain hopeful because I do not know what it is going to take to change their minds. I feel like they are stubborn and are not going to listen to a bunch of angry teens/young adults. I know there is power in quantity but sometimes it just is not enough.

I agree! It was touching how he apologized at the end. Yet, I find his efforts to communicate the climate crisis to be a better expression of his sincerity (though I am definitely not saying his apology isn't sincere) than what is briefly shown in the ending of the video. Ken’s actions are an example of one way one person working to solve the climate crisis can positively affect hundreds and thousands of people. I find his dedication rather inspiring. 
<br><br><hr><br>
Indeed, I was shocked by how sincere he was when watching the video. And I argued that the expression he had when he apologized communicated and connected with me better than a thousand words. Of course saying how sincere he was doesn't demean the actions he took against climate changes, but it was his sincerity and attitude at that moment was truly the most powerful tool to inspire, at least for me.

We are talking about Greta Thunberg again. Why?
<br><br>
She thinks that adults should do something for the good of children, and she gradually makes a lot, really, a lot of adults, for example, my Professor, thinking that they didn’t protect the Earth for the good of new generation. That adults didn’t address the issue of pollution, etc. Greta Thunberg, they are really pissed off.
<br><br>
However, my question is, why should adults do things for the good of children? Shouldn’t children manage on themselves? The world is cruel. No one has the responsibility of making others’ lives better for free. New generations should learn how to survive themselves. Adults shouldn’t feel ashamed, or feel bad, or feel sorry. Adults are already hard enough to fight for their own life. Children should learn and started to protect the Earth now because the Earth is not only belongs to children, but also belongs to adults and plants and animals in the wild. Don’t yell every day and make adults feel bad and do nothing. There are teenagers out their smoking and doing drugs, which are both harmful for the atmosphere…

Nobody in our generation owns manufacturing plants, nobody in our generation has been president, nobody in our generation is in congress. That's why the older generations should feel sorry. The extraction and use of fossil fuels were entirely carried out by people older than us. By the time you and I were even born into this world, the world had already embarked on a destructive path that is continuing to this day. Even today, we are only now of voting age and it will be another 7 years before any of us can run for public office of any kind. The reason it isn’t the fault of the teenage generation is that it would be physically impossible for us to have done anything. I echo the sentiment that our generation should practice what we preach and start making lifestyle adjustments in order to help our environment, but it is entirely unfounded to argue that our generation carries a significant portion of the blame for this crisis. Back in 1959, when the scientists were first realizing that our industrialization was effecting our climate THAT is when we should’ve acted. That was 41 years before I was even born, we should hold responsible those who had the power to make a change and chose not to. For example, Trump (73 years of age) pulled out of the Paris climate talks, our generation had ZERO say in that action, and yet, that choice will affect us the most. 
<br><br>
An interesting analysis I found by Zeke Hausfather, climate science Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley quantifies the generational inequity between baby boomers and millenials, “The result shows that older generations—particularly in the developed world—blew through carbon like it was going out of style, leaving younger generations will the equivalent of pennies left to spend. Because developed countries have both higher overall and per capita emissions than most developing countries, their youngest citizens will have to emit a much smaller amount of carbon than their elders. An average American boomer born in 1946, for example, has a lifetime carbon budget of 1551 tons. To keep warming within 1.5 degrees, their grandchildren born in 2017 will have a lifetime budget of 197 tons. The budget is substantially bigger with 2 degrees Celsius, but that will also come with tradeoffs like the likely loss of coral reefs and many small islands being rendered uninhabitable.”

<br><br><hr><br>
I don’t think that new generation can change the situation only when they have the power on voting, ‘presidenting’, or else. I am not saying it in a radical way. I know that it is hard for new generation to turn over the pollution situation, but it is not completely impossible. Greta Thunberg achieves that goal in a way. Although I don’t want others learn from her, she achieves that goal which means that it is possible. Again, I believe cigarettes are harmful to not only our health but also the atmosphere. If teenagers can change that habit, there will be significant change in the quality of the atmosphere.

I'm only partially joking. The thing I started feeling about halfway through the video was annoyance - yes, yes, the carbon dioxide ppm exploded over the period from the 1950s to 2020, yes, yes, it was over your lifetime, yes, yes, your generation of Americans kinda sucks, so did most of the intermediary generations of Americans, so do we, probably. 


Cool. Fine. Thanks for telling us. Really opened our eyes with that one.


All the apologies and self-flagellation and public confessionals, however, don't actually change what we as a species must accomplish. After a certain point, to me at least, it started to get a little grating - yes, I understand that you feel bad that your generation wrecked the environment, glad you realized it, now please help us fix it instead of making long-winded apologies.


I get that we'll probably get to solutions later, but right now I'd rather hear about "here are the problems, here's a list of our potential options to fix it, here's what things you want to support."

Viewing the climate crisis as a generational issue was not a new approach to the way I had been typically addressing it. The idea of acting responsibly in ways that benefited the planet, even though it was not a main concern of our senior generation, is nonetheless not on the forefront of our worries. I strongly believe that if more people in my generation were educated about the current situation with climate change more people would be inclined to take action. The common belief that electric cars or the use of other technology as the most effective method to aiding the reversal of climate change negatively influences the change we as a generation could be making. With that said, it is our duty to not only support and act on the methods that would actually positively help, like availability of birth control and changes in food production, but to educate more people to be aware of this. If not, we fail as the preceding generation did to take care of the planet not for ourselves but for them. The climate change crisis in relation to its development over one single lifetime really made the power of one stand out to me. Decades of inaction greatly contribute to the growing problems related to climate change, however the previous generation made a large dent. The significance of the preceding generation’s inability to not only take not action against climate change but to add to the problem leaves our generation in a difficult place. With that, my generation must abuse the power of one and ensure that we are all not only addressing the problem but taking full responsibility for our own actions. The cigarette example from the lecture video proved to me that our growing issues regarding climate change, even though not directly caused by us, is now put into our hands. In order to protect ourselves and those that come after us, we have to take action and not follow the pattern of those before us.

I was not surprised to hear that America, all European countries, and Russia can account for 2/3rds of the world’s CO2 emissions in the past 60 years. Why was I not surprised? Because America and many countries in Europe have held such great powers and they have abused it beyond great belief. However, when I read the fact that the poorest 3 billion have only contributed 5% of the world’s CO2 emissions I became angry. Angry at the complete disregard the wealthiest countries in the world have had for the poorer communities who face the consequences the most. I became angry because these communities have had little to no part in the current climate crisis, yet they will become dependent on the wealthy countries, mimicking past imperial relations if something is not done.

It is frustrating to me that the climate crisis was brought on by the previous centuries actions.  Now my generation has to deal with it and figure it out.  I also believe it's despicable that people try to postpone the fixing of this crisis by spreading misinformation and causing mis trust between onlookers and supporters.  It is making it hard for people to believe there is transparency still out there.  This is all being caused by short term gain but long term loss for the next generations.
<br><br>
It's frightening how quickly CO2 emissions are adding up.  We need to make a change before it's too late. We must find a way to gain support which will be hard because of the mistrust around the issue.

<p>
I feel that Ken sheds a very insightful light onto just how drastic of a role that recent past generations have played in the current climate crisis, leaving younger, and future generations to deal with the consequences and work tirelessly in an attempt to rescue our planet. Before this lecture video I was completely unaware that the effects of the rapidly increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere were delayed, leaving older generations to believe that there simply were no consequences at that time. However, as the direct and dire consequences are now extremely evident, and still a large percentage of older generations refuse to help, or even believe that changes must be made now, is extremely disheartening. Another point that Ken made that was very impactful is that this addiction to fossil fuels has been passed down, and as a result many youths today have adopted the same wasteful and harmful ideology of their parents, meaning a large percentage is still unwilling to take action and make change. However, it is also important to remember that the "youth rebellion" will only continue to grow, and will keep making noise until policy makers begin to listen, and systemic change is made. The fact that in the next 20 years, more CO2 could be put into the air than ever before is a call to action for today's generation to not only teach those around us about the deadly effects of greenhouse gas emissions, and what we can do to reduce carbon footprints, but to teach our children and future generations in order to prevent the harmful ideology many still hold today from being passed down.

<p>
It is truly disappointing and frustrating that the idea of people not understanding that their actions have consequences has enabled them to abuse the influence they have over the planet, which therefore endangers the lives of not only themselves, but the future generations of people, plants, animals, and ecosystems that took no part in the destruction. Capitalism has demonstrated itself time and time again to be a true evil, that enabled people to take part in the notion of conspicuous consumption and fulfill material desires at the expense of humans, wildlife, and Earth as a whole. It is a shame that just because some people cannot see it now, they believe that the way they consume and live will not turn out to be not only disastrous for them, but for the whole planet in the years to come.
<br><br>
As Prof Hiltner apologizes for the faults of his generation and the ones before him that contributed to the climate crisis and placed it on our generation to try and desperately combat it, I deeply wish the developed countries that are the leading emitters of CO2 into the atmosphere could have the same sentiments. They too need to apologize to the people living in poor nations of the Global South that did not even near to the extent contribute to the climate crisis as developed countries did, and yet they are the ones who have and will sadly continue to suffer the greatest. But apologizes from these capitalist nations won’t be enough to make things better, great change needs to be acted upon in order to try and prevent any more damage to be inflicted upon innocent lives. The massive corporations and politicians that enable them as well need to be held accountable for their roles in contributing to the crisis that will devastate the whole planet.

This video really shows how ignorant people were and still are. People were unaware of so astonishing to know how such a small portion of the world’s population contributes the most to this growing crisis. Yet somehow almost half of the world’s population, the poorest 3 billion people, only contributed 5% and are being affected greatly. It’s unfair for the habits of a small percentage of the population to affect the entire world. It angers me that there a people who do not take this situation seriously due to the fact that there is a time delay in the effects. There is still some time to act and that gives me hope that people will help save the earth.

While watching this video, I found the point about a time delay quite interesting. This idea argues that past generations, unaware (or uncaring) of the harms, continued to partake in such environmentally damaging actions, as no consequences were apparent at the time. Therefore, because of this time delay, actions to save the modern world from the current environmental hurt experienced today were ignored, leaving these most recent generations the task of saving the planet they only recently began to inhabit. Along these same lines of being unfairly affected by the climate crisis, it is upsetting to understand that the places holding the least responsibility for the alarming state of the planet are most touched by the consequences. As stated in the video, almost half of the population (3 billion people) make up only 5% of the polluters, and many of these people come from heavily affected areas. This is an unfair relationship between cause and effect (or causer and affected), highlighting an aspect of the injustice of the climate crisis. 
<br><br>
Although many in the current generation continue the lifestyle of the past without much regard for the health of the planet, it was majorly due to the actions of previous ones that caused the environment to be in so much trouble. However, the apology given by Ken on behalf of the generations before us, his students, reveals that there are some before us that are willing to take responsibility for their ignorant and selfish actions, which is a significant step in mending an injustice inherent in the climate issue.

I definitely agree with your response! The time delay of the climate crisis is extremely peculiar, considering how obsessed we became with extracting fossil fuels hundreds of years ago. The rate at which these extractions have been taking place have obviously skyrocketed, yet there’s a debate on whether the climate crisis is actually occurring or not. 
<br><br>
The fact that many people don’t believe that it’s real and on its way to making our planet uninhabitable, there’s no reason why they’d change their lifestyle to “protect” our planet. There is such a strong divide between people in today’s society regarding these topics, so it’s much harder to work together. Ken’s apology personally made me feel a certain way because it felt so unfamiliar to me. These important topics have been overshadowed by other topics, and no action is being taken. It’s great to hear that Ken is so passionate about the topic and is quick to apologize on behalf of his generation’s faults. I, myself, have not taken the issue as seriously as I should, but I’m starting to realize that it’s time to listen and figure out solutions.

Unfortunately Prof. Ken's generation will be remembered as ignorant, destructive, and self-serving. This is a sad reality. Just as we view world wars, discrimination against different groups and races and genders of peoples, and other phenomena of previous generations as " barbaric" and "unacceptable" so will the next generations view the one that brought about and failed to actively address (on time) the climate crisis.
<br><br>
We will think of all these people as hungry consumerists, people that were ignorant enough to destroy the world for money and power, and blatant enough to keep doing it even after they knew that what they where doing was plunging the Earth into the abyss.
<br><br>
On the other hand, I think my generation is oscillating between being the heroes or continuing the work of the villains. Now more than ever no one can plead ignorance to the crisis. People educated themselves and try to make meaningful impact in any way they can. We have a chance to be the good guys, the heroes, the generation that future generations will look at as the "saviors" of the world. My optimistic side thinks that this may very well be a possibility, we have no other option anyway. My pessimistic side though is not so sure...
<br><br>
main point:
<br>
While it may be nice and comforting to separate ourselves from the previous generation, the "climate destroyers", I see many of the same patterns sometimes even worse in our own generation. For example, we are consuming at a rate never seen before. People don't just workout to be healthy and look lean, but overstuff their bodies with all kinds of food and supplements. At what expense? The killing and torture of animals, and the subsequent pollution that comes with it. We think of all these living beings as objects that we can bring into life just to torture and kill, and for what? Just another meal, or to get big? This is the same line of thinking that brought about the climate crisis in the first place, this ignorance, this selfishness, this hunger for power. And the worst of all? Our generation has ALL the information, accessible immediately and in the palm of our hands, from virtually anywhere. We can no longer say "we didn't know better".
<br><br>
The excuses are less than ever before, and the consequences are greater than before. If the generation that brought upon use the climate crisis are the villains, then we can be the supervillains, or the superheroes.
</p><hr>

<p>
It is ridiculous now to distribute blame and blame on people who caused the climate crisis. A broken window is broken, punishing or saying sorry just won't do anything. Still like I said, I hope I can learn more actual and practical ways to fix the window instead of "feeling disgusted." I know it is still on an introducing level now, and I believe Ken will teach us how can we protect the Earth from further damaging. Now the problem for people is that, not only us in class but humans as a whole, MOST of us have not seen the bad consequences. We are still living in ease. Even we have seen the videos about them, but they never affect our lives whatsoever. Changing another method of propaganda might be a clue to make everyone realize the seriousness.
</p><hr>

<p>
The climate crisis is a generational issue. An issue cause by one generation and an issue that will have to be solved by another generation. Ken's comparison to smoking cigarettes in regard to polluting the earth really hit home the issue that polluting the Earth is a selfish en devour that essentially shows a lack of care for other people both born and unborn. It is also an action that has seems to become addicting as the use of fossil fuels has only increased over time because they do in fact make life convenient for many people. However we shouldn't jeopardize our future on the basis of convenience, moreover why should make efforts to shy away from the use of products that we feel make our lives better but hurt the world we live in. While climate change was cause by the generation before us, I think we are the generation that could potentially seal the fate of our world for better or for worse based on the actions we take within the next two decades.
</p><hr>

<p>
The climate crisis to me is honesty very frightening. I am not very optimistic about this kind of thing because if you really look at the details, we can tell people about what's going on and scare people or even just spread awareness. However, people have been doing that for years already and where has that gotten us? Nowhere. There really is not anything people can do or say to make people change their own lifestyles. Sure we have some people changing things here and there but really industries and big companies are the big problems. We are just the consumers, they are the providers. If you can not get them to change then nobody will. Our climate will continue to rise in heat and soon everyone will realize it when it is too late to go back. Nobody is going to really believe how big of an issue this is till it affects them personally and once everything starts to go bad those people who ignored the issues or said they were lies will be looking for help. Maybe if everyone finally got together to make a change or people in power put down some laws to stop people from hurting out climate then I think we would be able to save Earth. At this rate, however, we are getting nowhere. You can teach hundreds of these classes, but nobody really understands to severity of the event. People want to do things to help, but just do not want to put the effort or time to change what they are used to already.

It is no surprise to me that out of any generation, the youth is the most vocal about issues regarding climate change.  It is surprising, however, that over just a single lifetime, the severity of the climate crisis has skyrocketed dramatically.  To think that only about 60 years ago the impact of climate change was nowhere near where it is now truly baffles me and makes me disappointed that nothing was done sooner to relieve the impacts that are prevalent today.  Another disappointing factor in this generational issue is the fact that the United States is the leading contributor to this issue, despite the fact that our population is nowhere near the amount of other countries.  It is quite a shameful thing knowing that my own country has caused such a huge problem relating to the climate crisis, yet is doing the least to solve it.  Going into the future, I hope to see growing concerns from not just the youth, but older generations as well.  In addition, I hope to see further action taken by the United States to recognize the damages we have caused.  Although there will always be conflicting beliefs about the climate crisis, greater action can be taken from all generations regardless of their background.

I highly agree that the climate change is affecting all around the world. Nobody can escapes the effects of climate change. Some people still argue whether the effects of climate change should be considered. Like professor Hiltner said in the video, we cannot see the effects of the climate change in the short term. But in the long term, we can found that the effects of climate change not only affect ourselves, but also cause the environment become inhabitable for the next generation. Also, the developed countries produced much more CO2 into the atmosphere than poor countries. But most effects of climate change suffered by poor countries. There are much more pressure on low countries. They have no money to place refugees. It is terrible for these poor countries who are suffering the consequences of climate change. We need to try to slow down the rate of climate change.

<p>
Climate is a generational issue. Although climate change is not obvious now, when the ecology is destroyed, the climate will have an impact accordingly. The accumulation of problems will have a great impact on our future generations, and the climate will worsen. At the same time, we should understand that ecological damage is irreversible. Also, we should speed up publicity and education, so that more people realize the status of the environment and understand the importance of environmental protection. Meanwhile, we should learn the methods to protect the environment and put them into practice. We should call on more people to participate in the activities to protect the environment so that our future generations can have a living environment.

<p>
This lecture given by Ken hits home the point that the climate crisis we are facing today is largely an issue created by people still alive on this earth, but not necessarily by the people who will soon inherit it as adults. The selfish and short-sighted decisions made by countless governments, corporations, and self-interest groups have accumulated to a death wish for a sustainable planet. I find it crucial to note the exponential rate of which humans have contributed to the rising levels of atmospheric carbon into the atmosphere, especially after having known the science and data behind the detrimental effects our actions will have on our future earth. I appreciate Ken’s apology to my and future generations, but an apology will not be good enough. Our planet’s future demands immediate action and attention towards the lethal carelessness that is plaguing it’s precious functionality.
</p><hr>

<p>
Climate crisis could be a small thing for any individual people, but image, how the life will be if the climate crisis is serious enough. Everyone’s life will be effected. People will live in a polluted environment. I agree that people in our planet have nothing contribution to our planet. But they are still destroy it. So the government should do their jobs to make more contribution to protect environment and make sure people can live in a good condition and environment.

I believe that the real problem is that so many people think climate change is a slow process, and we still have enough time to find solutions and ignore this problem sometimes. However, that's not the case. According to The uninhabitable Earth that we have read, the IPCC warned that we will only have chance to avoid the catastrophic result if we halve greenhouse gas emissions the next 12 years. Only 12 years left, that’s not long since nowadays we even can’t find one perfect solution to every aspects of the bad effects. Additionally, people may also hold the opinion that they are far away from this issues, they normally drive to work everyday and live only for their conveniences. These people  may think climate crisis is the governments’ duty and environmentalists’ responsibilities and I can’t do anything to help alleviate the problem. However, I believe that we produce carbon emissions everyday and we should have the awareness that it is also our duty to reduce carbon emissions in our daily lives. Also, instead of just thinking for ourselves, it’s true that we may die before our earth begin to destroy, but what about our children and grandchildren. Think of them, and they need to suffer the catastrophic environment issues because of what we do today. What’s more, I am actually quite optimistic about the climate crisis’s future, since more and more people are alarmed and eager to do something to mitigate the global warming effects. For instance, in China, subway has already become the most important transportation method instead of cars. And we also have a program called the “Sharing Bicycles”. The bicycles have QR Codes, which you can scan it and the lock will be open when you want to use it. When you arrive at the place, you can just lock it again and park it anywhere. This is also a quite good way to combine the subway and bicycle, which allows us to go anywhere conveniently, to reduce carbon emissions and we don’t need to take our own bicycles upstairs or downstairs. People are coming up with new solutions and I am quite looking forward to see that day, that all the generations work together to find solutions and take actions to mitigate the bad consequences and make our earth habitable for longer and longer time.
</p><hr>

<p>
This climate crisis that we are currently involved in has risen in a single lifetime and continues to become worse as time passes. I am utterly appalled that in such a short amount of time, we can create such destruction to our environment. We continue creating this crisis because there is a time delay in our actions. Once an action against the environment is made, it could take decades or centuries to be discovered. Ken gives us an example involving cigarettes. What if we didn't see the consequences within ourselves but rather on the future generations of children? Would we continue smoking then? Are humans that selfish to continue the destruction? Humans seem to care more about themselves than the future generation which is also seen through the use of fossil fuels. There has been a 100 point rise in the use of fossil fuel in the last 400 years. We are becoming abusive to the Earth and a dramatic change does not seem to have been put in place. We have time to save the Earth; however, it doesn’t seem like most people are ready to part ways with fossil fuel and transform into a greener Earth. We need to welcome changes for a healthier today and tomorrow.
</p><hr>

<p>
The issue of the Climate Crisis is a generational one in that it will disproportionately disadvantage future generations more and more as current generations keep polluting. I like the analogy of smoking as hurting future generations since it helps illustrate the certain consequences carrying into the next generation. Humans are visual animals, and without seeing very real consequences, many people straight up deny that anything is happening. I’d like to make the case here that there have been aforementioned consequences attributed to climate change, but those primarily happened since the new millennium, and with age, many older generations became very skeptical that the climate is really changing this much. I think anger among the young generation, our generation, is well justified, but let’s not forget that anger can be blinding. To take effective action, channel that anger into productive solutions (scientific and political) that can make short run impacts. The climate strikes, even locally, can have a huge effect on converting older generations to seeing the facts as they are. There have been huge positive steps taken, and leaders like Greta Thunberg certainly get the ball rolling. 
<br><br>
It’s a kind of ironic sadness that the downfall of civilization as we know it is because of our pathetic material culture. It’s disheartening knowing that so little of the world’s population is responsible for such a ridiculous amount of pollution, and all because we weren’t content with a simpler lifestyle. One necessary aspect of slowing climate change is challenging consumerism in America. The older generations are taking vast resources, be it natural or economic, leading many young people to lose out on opportunities. The movement towards a less material culture, like many social and cultural movements in America’s history, needs to start with young people.

<p>
Professor Hiltner’s lecture, “The climate crisis as a generational issue” illustrates how his generation has deeply influenced the climate crisis we are living in today. Hiltner apologizes on behalf of his generation for having put three-fourths of CO2 out there today since the time of his birth in 1959 and for having been involved in decades of inaction towards climate change. I personally accept his apology for there are other issues to take into account when taking the blame. Professor Hiltner is considered a baby boomer, he as many Americans are a result of post World War II. The United States experienced a greatly elevated birth rate and hence population growth when soldiers returned home. Once the population increased, the demand for food and supplies subsequently increased as well. 
<br><br>

Society today is vastly informed about climate change and its consequences due to all the information filled with scientific evidence that is now available to us. The consequences of climate change are not apparent right away but nevertheless, they exist and accumulate over time. CO2 is the most significant greenhouse gas and is a result of fossil fuel burning. The United States alone generates a quarter of all CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. It is up to our generation to help spread awareness and take action in regard to climate change.

It would be nice if the rest of the boomer generation held the position of Professor Hiltner, and wanted to apologize for the CO2 emissions or fix the issue. I think perhaps one of the most infuriating part of the climate crises is how little the older generations are willing to listen to the voices of so many. I find it difficult to find any empathy in the older generations who can see that their individual greed is effecting so many, but continue to deny climate change, and refuse to change their ways. I can only imagine how easy it would be to change our way of life if the older generations had any ounce of responsibility for the damage they have caused. It makes me hopeful that their are people out their like Hiltner that spread awareness and will hopefully impact the future thought processes amongst older generations of people including boomers.

<p>
I feel like the problem with our generation is that many of us, not all but many, have simply come to accept the worse of climate change and therefore we fail to actually act and try to make a change. I find it hypocritical for us to just sit here and blame older generations without trying to do something about it ourselves. Like Ken said it is not too late, therefore we should make the effort to not only educate ourselves on climate change but also ensure that we aren’t repeating the mistakes that previous generations have made. We need to learn to practice what we preach and make efforts to do things such as reducing our carbon footprint, especially as Americans since we have contributed to 1/4th of co2 emission. We should learn to be more conscious about the food we eat, what kind of products we are buying and where we are buying from. It’s definitely important for Americans to realize the significance of climate change since people in other countries are facing the consequences of the problems that we have created.

The climate change issue reflect that human is short-version specie. Because the result will not show up immediately, the past generation did not take any action to control the amount of emitting CO2; what's worse, they rising it in an alarming rate. In 1959, the level of CO2 is 315 ppm, however, in 2019, its number is 415 ppm. Now, some of my generation complain and procession about climate crisis, such as Greta burg: the sunrise movement while others still choose to ignore the harsh truth and continue burning more fossil fuels. For those doing nothing, it is time to take action since the consequences are already happen during lifetime instead of  next generation. The unhabitable earth is a result faced by all, including past and current generation, also other living things on the Earth. Not only human will suffer, the animals will be extincted too.
<br><br>
Moreover, the climate crisis is faced by all people around the word, which means one person's fault will make all others to bear. According to the video, The Unites States emit 2/3 amount of CO2 while its population is only 1/8. The false of development country make the poor suffer more than the rich is clearly unfair. This climate justice is a new issue that required more attention. Every country should unite and work together to fix the problem since climate crisis is a concern for all human.

I perfectly agree with your opinion. Humanity is indeed the more intelligent species on earth, but we perhaps are also the most stupid and naive one. It is unquestionable that our technologies have benefited our life and we are using them to explore more in order to thrive our civilization. Meanwhile, we are using them to destroy ourself. We invented dozen of weapons, not only to protect ourself but also to kill each other. The two world wars are the perfect examples. I’m glad that nuclear weapons weren’t created before them. Also, unlike other species on the earth, human is the only specie that is destroying its own habitat with knowing that fact. Other species try to prosper their offsprings, but we are trying to suicide and, more radically, sterilize. 
<br><br>
Human is a funny specie. We will not stop an action and learn from its consequences unless we are severe hurt and damage from it. We won’t stop until we know it is the edge of destruction. For instance, two of the world war happened maybe because we know we weren’t going to extinct. But during the Cold War, we were aware that nuclear bombs could wipe out our entire civilization, so we did not send our missile in the air. Similarly, our pollution have not yet cause really severe problems so we keep poisoning our environment. However, I am afraid it would be too late to take action when the mother nature really starts to punish us. What we should do immediately are reduce the usage of fossil fuels (because immediately prohibit fossil fuels is impossible) and develop and invest in renewable energies so we (every living creature on earth) could live sustainable. I know this process will be full of obstacles, but I believe we eventually can achieve it as long as we have faith in saving our planet and ourself.
<br><br>
(by the way, it is the sum emission of US, Russia, and Europe that contribute 66% of the total emission, not US alone)

<p>
I think one of the main reasons so many climate change deniers exist is because CO2 is invisible. To Ken’s point about pouring oil in water to contaminate it, people would be able to see that the water they’re drinking isn’t pure and immediately would act and push for reform to drink clean water. However, no one can physically see how much carbon dioxide is being emitted into the air and how much is in the air already and because of this, people aren’t as quick to make actions and talk about the consequences. If CO2 were emitted as black smoke and we could see factories, cars, and other machinery pumping the 415ppm of co2 in the air, the world would’ve taken action before the effects of the Anthropocene made the damage irreversible. 
 <br><br>
I also agree that the time delay is another reason climate change deniers exist. Although my generation isn't the one who added a lot to the problem, we are the generation getting our houses swept away in hurricanes and possibly risk our hometowns going underwater. As complex as this issue is, I have some faith that this generation can be put up to the task. With rising political action like Greta Thunberg and the Sunrise Movement, our generation can hopefully halt carbon emissions to save my children’s generation from suffering.
</p><hr>

<p>
It's frustrating to face the fact that only around half the world's population has created this climate crisis, and the U.S. contributed a quarter of the emissions alone! Underdeveloped countries who didn't have access to the technology that is basis of other countries like Europe and the U.S. will be exposed to the disasters that they didn't contribute to. The poorest regions and their future generations will suffer as well, and likely far worse as they lack the resources that could help them, or because of their local climate. 
<br><br>
What surprises me is how monetary motivation can be more valuable than the planet that has even allowed such an option. Scientists, as well as the public, have noticed the climate changes over the past few centuries. London coined the term "smog" hundreds of years ago due to the copious burning of coal in a short period. The power of these practices have been known to be harmful for years, enough years that there could have been a more radical movement to inhibit the productions. Of course, the technology to predict these impending disasters was not yet invented, rendering the excuse for the delayed response slightly more digestible. However, I'm shocked and disgusted at the power of industries over scientific research and the vagueness of the truth expressed to the public, outweighed by monetary value and not sustainability.

Yes yes yes. The United States is an extremely influential nation and is by no means setting a good example for the rest of the world. It's disheartening to know that those in poorer countries will have to suffer the devastating effects caused by the actions of overprivileged people, driven by money.

Climate crisis could be a generational issue or could not be. In my perspective, climate crisis is an issue that caused by people's desirable to the resources of the earth. In order to increase the as much profit as they can, people try to find and use fossil fuels which would produce  tons of carbon dioxide into the the atmosphere and ocean. Due to the widespread usage of fossil fuel, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased several times than that of before. According to Ken, these kinds of circumstances will harm next generations of people or lives on the earth because the earth becomes uninhabitable. However, I think there is no need for professor to say sorry because the climate problem is caused by the progression of the whole society, so for some reasons it can not be avoided easily. Nevertheless, we still need to try our best to smooth the climate problem as much as we can.

The most terrifying thing about climate change is that it is all my generation knows. The cigarette analogy feels ridiculously accurate; like there is a punishment for a decision a small group of people made and continue to make; and as an American, I am part of that group. The mention of smoking is ironic too, for its relevance to the youth. If we continue the tobacco analogy, in that people used to smoke cigarettes and now know the risk for lung cancer, then by creating the vape, we have not fixed the problem. We have just put a new spin to the same cancer-stick. That is how I feel about this generation and its potential for solving climate change. At risk of sounding too much like a grumpy old boomer, I think my generation needs to step up. There is a large cultural force encouraging us to continue to habit, simply due to the fact that we live in a society. There are culturally established ways of living and there are cultural values that make climate change seem less bad than we think it is. Like the trendy habit of vaping, our news outlets and social media feeds are inundating us with commercials and consumerist habits telling us to participate in fast fashion and buy things off of Amazon because there’s two day shipping without a single regard for how this is possible. As an incredibly privileged member of the 4%, I appreciate Ken’s apology and I want to apologize too.

<p>
The disproportionate ratio between population and greenhouse gas emission is clearly unfair but it does give me a semblance of hope. It is much easier to mobilize part of their world to change their policies and lifestyles than it is the whole world; still this is yet a difficult task. Holding ourselves and the rest of the developed countries accountable for these changes should hopefully help to control the situation, which is why I truly believe that the activity that my current generation is more than justified. We should push for policies that ensure our future. It is sad to think that the actions, and even the inactions, of some can negatively impact the lives of many.
</p><hr>

<p>
I believe that the climate crisis we as humans have created is due to technological advancements that have given us the modern world. The only solution out of this crisis in my eyes is through improved technology that is more environmentally friendly. To simplify our situation is to suppose we have dug ourselves a hole for almost half a century with no respect for how we would escape it as digging down meant our current survival. We are now at that time in humanity where we were born in this hole and looking up and realizing we are completely screwed. Our only solution is to innovate and cater to what we have been left with.

<p>
Today, the climate change crisis is lead by the youth. The worlds biggest activist is just a teen - Greta Thunberg. At age 15, she began forgoing her enducation to try and educate her elders on an issue she felt was more important - literally trying to save her planet. But that is unfortunately how it has to be due to the enormous generational gap in the way climate change is viewed. A large majority of people who dont believe in climate change are older - people who ultimately, in the last 60 years, accelarated the emission of greenhouse gases beyond managable levels. Unfortunately, this generation, while also having generated this issue, refuses to change their actions still, so while as the generation below, we have to deal with the painful consequences, we still can't combat the rates that emissions are still occurring quick enough. This makes me sad because we shouldn't have to battle our elders to have a chance at saving our future.
<br><br>
CO2 stays in our atmosphere for hundreds, perhaps even thousands of years. This means that even if we completley stopped emmitting greenhouse gases right now, we will still experience warming and bad consequences of greenhouse gases for a long time before we start to see positive reducitons. This is why we need to stop right now. Becuase otherwise, we risk the planet forever. It is really hard for us to simply look at projections and models of how climate change will change our planet but incidently, we dont have to look at projections and models anymore, we can simply look outside. Given enough time, both humans and animals can adapt to the harsh conditions we are creating for ourselves. But  the rate of accellaration we are seeing now, will destroy us before we even have the chance to try and adapt ourselves for the gross world we have created.

I find it crazy that the climate crisis was developed only a couple generations back. The mistakes made by previous generations should be prevented by today's generation, but it is not. Instead today’s generation was taught to live the same way instead of living sustainably. This in fact is going to leave us with an uninhabitable planet soon if we don’t start making changes. It is great to see that people are recognizing these issues and trying to partake in making a change, but this will be hard with only a small percentage of people doing this. By continuing to abuse our Earth, it will cause a snowball effect that is going to be passed along to our children. If we can’t make a change now, how will our children learn to live better? They will continue to make the same mistakes that the previous generation taught us causing our planet to deteriorate quicker. 
<br><br>
I found it mind blowing that the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere has risen so many points within a short period of time as well. It’s crazy to think that we started out with only 280 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere, and now we are at roughly 415 ppm of CO2 as of 2019. It’s even worse to think that the United States alone is causing ¼ of this CO2 into the atmosphere. This is such a large amount of CO2 for us only making up a small part of the population.
<br><br>
I never realized that the time delay was such a big impact on the climate crisis either. Due to this delay, the climate crisis became worse because people didn’t see the effects it was having on the Earth until later. I'm hoping that since we are aware of how bad the impacts are on our Earth, our generation can step up and make a change for the future generations and life on our planet. If we don’t start this change now, who knows what our Earth’s fate will be when we have children.
</p><hr>

<p>
Although the climate crisis was caused the generation before us, we cannot just blame them for everything and simply get rid of it. We all live in the same world, and it is our duty to protect it. In the video The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue, I am glad to see that people in our generation actively take actions and calls for change. I am astonished by the fact that the United States is the country that releases the largest amount of carbon dioxide, even though the Americans only accounts for 4 percent of the world population. At the same time, people who are in the developing countries are severely suffered by the climate crisis which is not mainly caused by them. However, if the United States takes actions first to fight against the climate change, people in other countries might follow and the process would be accelerated because of great efforts from everyone in the world. Ken’s apology for climate crisis caused by their generation is sincere and I really feel his regret from his speech. But I think we all need to do something to change the situation, no matter which generation we belong. The earth is our home, and we must protect it with great effort.

While the climate crisis was mainly brought about by the generation before, I don’t think we can fully blame them for everything. Yes, our generation was born into the climate crisis already, but upon learning about it, not many of us have tried to change our lifestyles to try to do something. We can blame it on the generation before us, saying that it was them who taught us to live this way, but it is also partially our own fault for not choosing to change our lifestyles to accommodate for the wellbeing of our world. Before taking the class prior to this one (Eng 22), I was largely not aware of just how bad the climate crisis was. I was aware that it existed and that people were doing things to make a change, but I never thought that it was as bad as it is. Even after learning about it, I feel like I have done little to change my lifestyle to make things better, and I feel very guilty about it. As people who lived in the developed world, we do not see the consequences of the climate crisis as clearly. Yes, we hear about the natural disasters all around the world, but ultimately, hearing about them is not the same as experiencing them. I find it very unfair that those that barely contribute to the climate crisis are the ones suffering the most from it. 
<br><br>
That is not to say that there are not people trying their best to make a change. As mentioned in the first lecture, the youth movement is flourishing, and there are many young people hoping for a change. I find that very admirable, and I hope to be able to do my part to help this earth. I want to be more aware of what I am doing and what impact I will have on the future of this planet. I think that it starts with the little things, and those are the things that are the hardest to change. These little things pile up, but at the same time, when someone is doing something small (such as purchasing products with excessive plastic packaging) even if they are aware of the possible negative environmental impact, they do not think it will be a very big impact. This is precisely the mindset that I hope to overcome, and I hope others can overcome, too. We must work together to create a better world for us all.

<p>
"The climate crisis is a generational issue" is a movement that implies only the youthful can get behind. It seems this generation is showing empathy for their kin and prosperity for their future family. However, everyone needs to relate to this cause because only the people alive today can stop this doomsday from happening. I'm sure our future generations, who might have to grow up in a toxic earth, will be appalled by our selfishness of we do not act now. 
<br><br>
The video, "How the climate crisis was brought by a single generation," is more emotional than others about the climate crisis because of the pathos techniques of babies and children implemented in this video. Their helplessness demands the help of the entire world, but mostly the US, Europe, and Russia. That small group of people who are responsible for this catastrophe continue to milk the planet of its health. Ironically, the few causing this problem are also the ones not doing anything about it but making it worse. I was aware of pollution being a bi-product of the industrial revolution, but I never imagined that one generation is practically solely responsible for the thousands of future years of damage to the earth. Perhaps the cigarette metaphor is more accurate than intended, because that generation is severely addicted to burning fossil fuels, and showing no signs of checking into a rehab facility anytime soon.

I like how you described the first video as a “movement” from the younger generation. Seeing clips from the 2019 Santa Barbara Climate Strike made me feel more hopeful that the future perhaps won’t be as disastrous as we predict. This might be a little random, but I did look up the date for the climate strike this year. However, I am a senior therefore I won’t be able to make it since I will be leaving Santa Barbara before the summer quarter. I hope if you are still attending UCSB next academic year, the strike is on September 27, 2020. Maybe you can show others that we are not selfish, and we can play a role in this redemption. 
<br><br>
It’s interesting that you mentioned the use of the pathos technique in the second video. I think that is a very strong and convincing factor to make us care more about the environment with our own children. Advanced nations are relied upon for rescuing the human race out of this sinking hole, but these countries are also the culprit for putting all of us in this mess in the first place. As you know from yesterday’s lecture, the comparison between the carbon footprints left behind by an American and an African was shockingly disproportional. I hope that the citizens of United States will focus more on the problem that we are creating instead of blaming others for not putting in the work to save our planet. Lastly, the cigarette example resembled some sort of butterfly effect to me. Similarly, if climate change persists, it will only cause more damages in the future.
<br><br><hr><br>
Thank you so much for making me aware of the next strike. Lucky, I have some more time at this university and will be very interested in being involved in my first strike. From having many misconceptions and misinformation about the climate crisis, this class has made me more passionate about climate change than any other societal issue thus far. I look forward to sharing my striking experience with others, like you have done, in order to get more people to buy into the cause. 
<br><br>
Much like how our young generation is the key to increasing the strength and volume of this movement, I predict the next generation of children and babies will be the final key to resolving global warming. They will be the symbol for the future through their pathos appeal and hopefulness for the good of humanity. 
<br><br>
I agree with your comment about the butterfly effect with the cigarette metaphor, which highlights the diffusion of responsibility of the selfish select few polluting the earth.

Like what Ken said, "it's not too late to act". The globe is rapidly responding to us over what humankind has been doing for decades with many horrible climate events happening these years: as the Earth is getting warmer and warmer, iceberg in the arctic regions are melting, which cause sea level to rise and slowly emerge some islands and coastal cities. The hurricanes are getting stronger and stronger because the sea level rise, and caused more damage to our cities they passed. As we are doing something that seems not gonna affect ourselves, we are gradually affecting other people living together with you. Like what is showed in the video, cigarette is causing children to have lung, heart diseases, and even cancer ever since they are born, and these diseases may be passed to grandchildren of those smokers. Human activities are also causing lots of species on the planet to reduce the population, or to extinct from the globe. For example, a big portion of corals living in the shallow waters are now died out because the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is too big and they are absorbed by the ocean. This is so-called ocean acidification and is the major reason why corals are becoming fewer and fewer.
</p><hr>

<p>
I can’t believe that four percent of the entire world’s population has emitted about twenty-five percent of all carbon emissions and on the other hand, three billion of the poorest people in the world have emitted five percent of carbon emission. All of this has happened in the past 60 years. Maybe it's the poverty that those 3 billion people live in that reduces their carbon footprint because they don’t have as many items that generate carbon into the atmosphere. It's their minimalist life that helps them to keep their emissions so low. I'm not saying that we should live in a minimalistic society to keep our carbon footprint low. With how technologically advanced the United States it is so crazy to believe that our country isn’t switching quickly to renewable energy. Just by switching to this type of energy we can reduce the number of fossil fuels we use which can help to slow down climate change drastically. The older generations don’t realize the terrible conditions that they have left the Earth for the younger generations. It is a problem that they don’t realise this because they are the ones in power so they are the ones that pass laws to help lead the people to a healthier lifestyle to help the Earth.

<p>
From this video, we realize that the climate change is not caused by centuries. It is caused by the generation who is still alive and even makes it worse. However, there are still many of people did not see the results. The video carefully presents the issue by illustrating how the oil will contaminate the water little by little. And also it explains the climate crisis by analogy. Take smoking for example. The harm of smoking will affect many generations. As a result, what we did will significantly affect our children and grandchildren. All life of the earth will also suffer from what we did now. We cannot be that selfish, right? The level of carbon dioxide is continuously rising, 100 points, which affects the nature. The whole developed world contribute 67 percent of the total carbon dioxide emission, even though the population of them is only one eighth of the whole population. However, the developing countries also suffer from the climate change.
</p><hr>

<p>
Compare to the word climate change, the climate crisis is a more precise description of our current situation. Ken mentions the uneven emission of CO2 in this world, and I felt so bad that there are three billion poorest people in the world who just responsible for five percent of the CO2. The truth might be that they are the first group of people being forced to swallow the bitter consequences of the climate crisis. I agree with Ken that people should act to help with our climate very soon, and many of them had been saying for decades but a few of them put into practice. I’ve heard slogans such as Save Our Climate since I was very little, but the truth tells me there are no significant changes happened. 
<br><br>
The ppm rises 100 points in the past 60 years (315-415), and this is much faster than normal growth. People from advanced countries might have abilities and monetary power to stay away from climate change consequences for a while, but for people in poor countries, these consequences would be destructive to their lives. I realized it is important to educate the public more about climate change and let more people put in effort right now when it is not too late to maintain this beautiful world for us, and for future generations.
</p><hr>

<p>
Both lectures address the issue of climate crisis from the point of sustainability concisely. People don’t take strong action to stop abusing the planet as they are largely unaware of the significant time delay before the horrible consequences are perceived. The amount of CO2 has increased three times faster in the last decade. The data speaks for itself. It creases unfairness across the world as more developed countries tend to consume more of greenhouse gas while the poor countries which don’t contribute to the air pollution have to suffer the same situation. As far as I’m concerned, the amount of CO2 is hard to reduce even though there are policies such as carbon tax. We can try to limit the amount step by step which will definitely benefit us in the long run. Professor Ken’s apology moved me deeply as it’s a generational issue that requires everyones’s social responsibility. In order to preserve a better planet for our future well beings, we had better protect the planet and its resources as soon as possible.

<p>
It is very common to believe that the climate crisis we are facing right now are developed through generations. However, in the lecture Professor Hiltner suggest that the climate crisis can develop within one generation, and the people who caused the climate crisis we have right now can still be alive. It is important for us, as the young generation, to fully understand and take actions to help improve the climate crisis. A lot of people who are not paying enough attention to the climate crisis are because of the negative effects of the environmental problems will not develop overnight. It takes a long time to prove the cause and effect relationship between human actions and the environment issues, so it is easier for people to ignore the problems. 
<br><br>
When thinking about the climate crisis, people should not limit themselves in the current situation. We should have the foresight of the effects of our actions for future generations. It is too late for us to wait for others to take actions first that we need to have the initiative to start changing and improve our environment. We cannot just leave the crisis to our kids and let them suffer for what we have done in the past.
</p><hr>


<p>
The generation of our parents is the major contributor to the climate crisis, and yet people of such generation appear much more indifferent than the younger generation. One of the explanations for the generational split is the delay of cause and effect, which makes sense because different generations are raised in very different environments. I think another reason would be that younger people are simply more involved in social issues in general. 
<br><br>
Professor also says that the developing world contributes very little to climate crisis, and yet people in developing countries have to suffer much more than those in developed countries. I remember this statement from the film Before the Flood, and I also remember who angry the Indian women was, for the developed world being irresponsible and knowledgeable about what they are doing and what is going on.
</p><hr>

<p>
Environmental injustice is a huge topic in united states and within the generation in the past decades. With the absolutely disproportionate amount of carbon emission, developed countries, especially the US, are forcibly inflicting the terrible consequences on countries that have done little to cause climate crisis. Meanwhile, our father generation refuses to admit that our fossil fuel indulgent lifestyle needs to change. Big enterprises still are vigorously promoting consumerism and pushing the public onto a vicious circle. Profits and politics must stand aside now. The not only but most lethal crisis of climate human race must now act.
<br><br>
It is time for people to wake up and do something for mother earth, and that has to start from us.
</p><hr>

<p>
Many people see climate change as a generational issue, however it is obvious that there is no one generation to blame for our perpetual inaction and unwillingness to take action towards creating a solution for climate change. Climate change is a largely ignored topic and although we have seen massive increases in PPM (around 100 points from 1959 to 2019), large corporations and wealthy countries are still burning massive amounts of fossil fuels and emitting lots of CO2 into the atmosphere. As seen in the video, young people have been protesting and bringing attention to the problem and although more and more people are becoming involved in the movement to slow down climate change, our data shows that we need to take even more action. Especially from the US, which emits around a quarter of the total global greenhouse gases, I think we need to spread even more awareness about the climate crisis and take action by voting for leaders who will vote for climate change and believe in the climate crisis.
<br><br>
What stuck with me the most throughout the duration of this video was the negative and long-lasting effects that our actions have on the climate and on the global community as a whole. Many people don’t realize that the climate change issue not only affects people living on this plant currently, but the many generations down the line that will face even worse living conditions and a further deteriorating global environment if we do not start acting now. Like Ken states, our current inaction will put our future generations face to face with the dangers of climate change. We cannot be selfish anymore and isolate ourselves from a problem that involves every single person on this planet; climate change is a global problem and we need to make our best efforts to help save the planet for our future generations.
</p><hr>
<p>
We are the only living species that can create this kind of irreversible disaster. This has been a topic that I think about a lot actually and bring up in conversations with my friends. I am so puzzled and still shocked that we as humans have had the ability to create so many great things yet selfishly destroy the planet that we live on. It is a frustrating topic and it is so easy to become so caught up in the tragedy where it feels almost hopeless. During this lecture, Ken mentions that 3/4ths of all the C02 on this planet has been produced in his lifetime. We makeup for only 4% of the worlds population and we contribute 1/4 of all the C02. As our life expectancy raises this raises the amounts of C02 as well speeding up the process of this climate crisis. Something that helped me understand the Climate Crisis footprint is the cigarette example. If 1 in every 8 people smoked cigarettes, the effects would be so harmful that for hundreds of years to come children would be affected the moment they are born, growing into affected adults. Even though our generation might not be the ones to deal with the direct extreme repercussions head on we are creating a worse climate that a lot of us would like to bring children into one day. Ken your apology to our generation is extremely sincere and left an impact on me. I hope that the apologies from older generations can stop here so we don’t have to say the same things 20 years from now to the new generation. Even though there is a lot of what seems to be irreversible damage, the young generations are eager to be educated and we are vocal about the change we need to see. We as future educators are able to use our voice but I am hopeful that having people in power positions who can make a bigger change will happen as well.
</p><hr>

<p>
The two most angering and unfortunate things about climate change is how only 4% of the entire global population is responsible for an extremely unacceptable amount of CO2 emissions. 4% of the population is the reason why the rest of the world is suffering through climate change. In addition, the past generation (baby boomers) are passing on this planet to the new generation in a beyond horrible condition. The fact that they let our Earth get this bad AND many are still not taking action is terribly unacceptable. Climate change IS a generational issue. Many people who allowed for it to get this bad won't live long enough to see the effects, meanwhile the newer generation will suffer the consequences of the (in)action of the previous generation. I believe the cigarette example perfectly explains the climate crisis. It is the elder generation who is smoking and the generations after that are suffering the consequences. In the same way, the U.S. is doing the smoking, while the rest of the population, including animals and plants, are suffering the consequences. 
<br><br>
On another note, it is a great relief that there are many people taking action to try to reverse the effects of climate change and make our Earth better again. It is also great that there are people from the elder generation, such as Ken, who stand with the current generation in this race to save our planet.

<p>
It is disheartening that as a first-world countries, the United States contributes to the factors of climate change more significantly than many other cultures and regions. Less privileged and resource-abundant civilizations do not contribute to climate change as much as the US does, and yet, those civilizations are the most exposed to the negative aspects of climate change. I am enraged that the generations before us have expedited the decay of our environment and planet, and have left it up to us (my generation and proceeding generations, and the select few from the problem generations). I feel as if there is little understanding of the genuine and intense consequences of the actions that were a catalyst to climate change. Would that generation change their behavior if they were educated like my generation has been? Education has evolved and the curriculum that I am privileged enough to take discusses events like this. If parents and grandparents knew that their oblivion would eventually accumulate to be detrimental to their planet and possible family members?
<br><br>
There should be more outrage, more protests, and more call for action. More importantly, we need leaders, scientists, students, professors, engineers, parents, everyone, to take action individually and collectively. There should be less apologies and more plans of attack, and more questions of what can be done to help.

<p>
It is frustrating to have the people who handed us this problem spend their final years on Earth trying to keep us from fighting it while they are still in power. The Koch brothers, for one, are two prime examples of men who have lived long lives building their empire off of destruction. Yet, when handed the facts, they are so afraid of coming to terms with what their empire is built on that they would rather attempt to keep it from being accepted as the truth. By the time people like this die out though, it will be too late to save the Earth from their actions, for the damage is already partially done. So we are left with two options: convince them of the truth (which will never happen), or elect people and vote for laws that will keep these people from causing anymore damage to the future of the planet. I don't expect an apology from the previous generation, because it would be fair to say they didn't know much better for a long time. However, at this point, I do expect them to attempt to atone for what damage they've knowingly done. They could do this by using their many resources to help future generations instead of hiding their billions away.

The detail of the climate crisis that makes the mistakes made to lead our planet's condition to this point so egregious is the horrific inequality. The fact that the emissions of the top 3 most developed countries make up 66% of the total carbon emissions while the combined emissions of the poorest 3 billion only make up 5% is ludicrously cruel. This means that the top 12.5% of people have committed 66% of the problem, while the bottom 38% have committed a mere 5%. This inequality is exacerbated by the fact that poor people in countries all over the world will feel the powerful negative impact of climate change first and more acutely than the rich and developed. Poor countries and small islands that contribute almost nothing to total carbon emissions will be absolutely devastated by the extreme weather conditions and natural disasters caused by climate change, while the rich and developed countries that make up most of the carbon emissions will be able to deal with the consequences of climate change for a good while longer than less developed countries. When a small percentage of the planet's population fails to address and deal with the problem of reckless carbon emissions and resultant climate change, the entire population suffers.
</p><hr>

<p>
It is truly unfair that our next generations born in rather poor areas will suffer more that one born in rich regions whose people actually contribute most percentage of Co2 in the atmosphere. ken used his lifetime as the timeline to show us how crazy the ppm of CO2 has changed over few decades and how it might continuously to grow in next 20 years. We, as the generation becoming having more voices on the globe, are suffering from what our former generation had not do enough, this is a kind of lesson we should learn, that knowing we need to save the earth for our own next generations to make this place less uninhabitable.
</p><hr>

<p>
I think that it is incredible that to connect the terrifying estimates for the future that now face us, that we only have to go back one or two generations to find the root of the issue. I completely agree that the obsession for not only fossil fuels, but also rampant consumerism and individualistic ideals, have been passed on to the millennial and Gen-Z generations. I am grateful that a lot of people seem to be reconsidering these mindsets (at all ages) with the goal of creating a healthier Earth. I believe that the mistakes of previous generations should serve as lessons for the future and that we should do whatever is possible to salvage our rapidly changing planet. I also thought that the smoking analogy was very interesting. I think it helps to create a visualization of why should stop certain behaviors immediately. I would never want the burden of lung disease, etc. to be carried on to future generations because of my actions and I don't think anyone else would either. This same feeling of not wanting later generations to bear the burden must be connected with climate change. If there were the same association made when driving a car, or throwing out old food, or eating meat to this smoking analogy, I think a lot of climate change causing behaviors could be curbed.

I'm replying to your comment for a couple of reasons.  Firstly I also found the smoking analogy to be extremely powerful as a descriptor of what time frame we are looking at when considering the effects of climate change.  If one in eight people smoking caused the rest of children born to have lung cancer, strokes and heart disease, smoking would be banned worldwide within a day.  Yet with the issue of climate change we seem collectively unable to grasp the severity of the damages we are doing to our future generations, and the pain they will have to face inheriting a world we didn't care enough about.  If more people were able to think of their actions today directly contributing to the harm of others in the future, I think they would be more empathetic and more likely to change.
<br><br>
Secondly your comment on past generations serving as a warning for the future struck a chord with me.  The video talked about how causing the climate crisis within a lifetime was not the only problem of the previous generation, but also failing to educate their offspring about how to act differently then they did.  This was an angle I had never considered before, and it made me rethink what we should be doing to help our bleak situation.  Although we can think and think trying to come up with solutions to the issues at hand, educating more people about how they can help right now will undoubtedly buy us more time and bring new minds to the discussion of how to fix our mess.
<br><br><hr><br>
I do agree that what have done in the past are done and what we need to do now is to get to the root of the problem and understand why things happen in that way and how we can make changes on the current problem and prevent it to happen in the future again. And yes, fossil fuels is just one of the problems causing global warming and a lot of many other individual acts and events that produce greenhouse gases are also what cause the climate crisis, which is why it is important that everyone of us should be more well educated about global problem and know what are some activities we are doing in daily lives will worsen the climate crisis and learn how to take immediate actions from now on. The smoking analogy(whichI also mentioned in my comment) is not only interesting but it is really helpful on alarming people and let people know how serious it can be for the bad impacts to be brought to the next generations and affect the children for the future years which is something we all don’t want to see. Everyone has the right to live on the planet includes our next generation and it is the responsibility for us to take care of the planet we are living to give ourselves the sustainability to live on earth equally, healthily and happily.

I find it difficult to believe that the climate crisis has been caused by people who are still alive, and yet, these people still have not made significant efforts to stop it. Everyone, specifically politicians and corporation owners, continues their same lifestyle at the sake of our planet. Even though the first fossil fuels were used 400 years ago, it has not become a major issue until now, demonstrating how much damage we have inflicted in the recent years. The release of CO2 into the atmosphere from fossil fuels has continued to increase in unprecedented levels, which I find shocking. At the same time, the massive levels of CO2 makes sense when accounting for all the ways fossil fuels are used today, and no laws or regulations are in place to curb it. It also makes sense how the negative changes to the environment were not visible for such a long period of time, considering how large the planet is. However, with such delays in the consequences, people will continue to believe that climate change is not an extreme issue, which is dangerous. I think Ken’s comparison to cigarettes was very powerful; it definitely inspires me to help the environment, especially after learning that America is responsible for a quarter of all the CO2 emitted from the atmosphere. As an American, I find this very disappointing, and I hope we will eventually take action to change this.
</p><hr>

<p>
It is hard to imagine that the atmosphere could get a lot worse in a person’s lifetime, which is much faster than it used to be. Especially it not only influences one generation but several generations.  A few decades ago, people were benefiting from the burning of fossil fuels without considering the side effects, and now we have to pay for the action they have done. The United States, being one of the “leading countries” of the releasing CO2, has to do something just to help the atmosphere, for other countries who actually did nothing with CO2, and for the children in the future. We have always been taking what we have for granted, and never thinking about the damages we put into the air while we are driving the car, keep the ACs on even we are not home for long periods of time. We, as the people on Earth, thought that what we do is just a little damage to the world. But imagine over 7 billion people are thinking the same thing, imaging the pollution I have done to Earth times 7 billion. That is a terrible result that it could ever get.

Like what you are saying, the people who were benefiting from fossil fuel and made the world worse are still doing the same thing today. They can only see the profit that fossil fuel gives, but ignore the dangerous it formed. For example, some politicians in the US are getting benefits from the fossil fuel company, so that in order to keep their profit, denying the theory of climate change, joking at many scientists' research are what they did to the public. There are 327 million people live in the US, and the US is the second biggest country that emits CO2. In contrast, there are 3 billion poor people live on Earth, while they only contribute 5% of the greenhouse gases. We should self-exam. Why we are keeping the ACs on when we are not home? Why we drive cars with only 5 minutes' road? We want our life to become valuable, then take action. You think your action is little, but our action is huge.

I was shocked to learn that the poorest three billion people in the world only contributed to five percent of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Not only have those three billion people emitted the least amount of CO2 compared to developed countries, but the fact that they will also be suffering the worst of consequences is unsettling. This just goes to show how developed countries, such as the United States and Russia, have negatively impacted the Earth’s well-being. What frightens me the most from this lecture video, is the fact that the ppm of carbon dioxide will continue to increase at alarming rates as time goes on, yet I do not think we are doing enough to change our impact on this issue.
</p><hr>


<p>
I don't know what it is about the baby boomer generation and the generation that followed them that allowed them to view the earth and not a gift to humanity but a means of short term profits. I believe a fundamental part of the American dream is to give your children a better life than what you were given. The way the climate crisis is playing out really tossed this American dream out the window. From this point on every child will be born into a world in worse shape than the earth their parents inhabited. The individuals behind the fossil fuel industry must believe that their wealth will protect them and their families from the effects of the climate crisis, the sad reality is that this will most likely be the case. As with every challenge humanity has faced in its short history the poor are always the ones who pay the most. After finding out that the poorest three billion are only reasonable for 4% of the problem this injustice feels so much more unfair.

<p>
After watching Professor Hiltner’s two lecture videos: “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” I was left with a feeling of unease as I began to realize the true weight of the issue. 
<br><br>
Professor Hiltner blames and apologizes for his generation, and credits our generation as trailblazers in solving the climate crisis. Although our generation feels resentment towards previous generations, there are still many unfortunate parallels between the two generations. While our generation is trying to solve the climate issue, this attempt can only be credited to a very small portion of people. These people are usually educated and have enough resources to be able to attempt to tackle the problem. 
<br><br>
I can see history repeating itself as my generation covets materialistic and excessive wealth such as Mcmansions, luxury cars, and fast fashion. I agree with Professor Hiltner when he expresses that people are so reliant on a wasteful, fossil-fueled lifestyle, it is difficult to imagine life without it. Even though I am more educated than most on the issue, I still have a hard time imagining myself actually adhering to the solutions that are proposed such as converting to a plant-based diet or giving up flying.
<br><br>
Following Professor Hilter’s analogy of cigarettes, people did not care much about prevention until the consequences were blatantly harmful. From then on, the US banded together on a “war against cigarettes” as anti-cigarette ads were bombarded everywhere-from social media sites to physical billboards. Only after years of this aggressive campaigning did the attitude on cigarettes begin to shift to socially unacceptable. With climate change however, there is not nearly enough information or campaigning done in order to spring the current generation to action. While our generation has an idea that climate change is generally bad and happening, this idea is still so big and abstract, it is easily pushed to the back of our minds as we worry about more instantaneous topics. While almost nobody would ever claim that a cigarette is non-malignant, there are still many climate-change deniers, with many of them residing in the top seats of our government.
<br><br>
Human beings are extremely capable beings and have the potential to create impact of huge magnitudes when we put our minds to it. Despite this, like Professor Hiltner states in the video, our species has an issue of acting only when the crises can be visibly felt. As history has shown time and time again, people prefer to simply slap a bandaid on the consequences of their actions rather than to prevent the issue from happening in the first place. However, by the time we begin trying the reverse the damage, it will already be too late. 
<br><br>
I just hope history will not repeat itself and that our current generation will take a more proactive and aggressive stand against preventing further harm to the planet.

Your comment in particular was thought-provoking for me, especially when I had read the words “Mcmansion, luxury cars, and fast fashion.” Our whole nation has an extremely unhealthy addiction to excessiveness. One great example is the short film “Super Size Me,” where the documentary follows an individual that eats a “super-sized” meal from McDonalds every day for a month. The results were, as expected, devastating. Aside from our jumbo portions in food, an unrealistic aspect of American citizens is the pursuit of “success” that we define as income. For instance, in Calabasas and “The Hidden Hills”, hundreds of celebrities purchase multi-million dollar homes that take up thousands of square footage. Their ten-bedroom homes that are filled with a only a mere few people are extremely wasteful, when the land on our Earth is a limited resource. In addition, the private jets that are flown across the country week after week, only carrying a couple passengers, is definitely a contributing factor to the CO2 in our atmosphere. Why are these expensive luxuries that harm our environment considered the “dream” for many Americans? Why do we call this a “flex” when it pushes us closer to doomsday? 
<br><br>
Another excellent point you made was fast fashion. Many popular American brands, such as Forever 21 or Fashion Nova, implement borderline slave-labor and also utilize a ton of resources. It costs 2,000 gallons (or 7,600 liters) of water to produce just one pair of jeans. With this knowledge, why do Americans continue to purchase a brand new pair of jeans when there are multiple thrift stores that sell second-hand clothes? Why do Americans love to overshop when their materialistic needs are fulfilled by resource-consuming tactics? These are questions that cross my mind every time I walk through the mall, or read company disclaimer statements. We are advanced enough in technology to use recycled material to produce new clothing and informed enough to thrift second-hand clothes. I hope that one day, we as a country realize that our overconsumption is negatively impacting our planet, as we are the reason for a quarter of the world’s CO2 emissions.

I was surprised when Professor Ken points out that climate crisis can be created within only ONE generation, which is quite a relatively short period. However, the time delay between the actions and the consequences makes people think that what they have done has little to do with the environment. At the very beginning, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was only about 280ppm. Then mankind showed up and began to digging coal. In 1959 the concentration rose to 315ppm and in 2019 up to 415ppm. From the above data analysis, within only one generation, 3/4 of the total CO2 was emitted into the atmosphere by mankind. That is crazy. Many people have the fallacy that a country with more people will have more CO2 emission. To redress people’s thought, what Ken did later was to make a deep analysis of the CO2 emission: 2/3 of the CO2 was let out by developed countries, whereas the total population of these countries is only about one-eighth of that of the whole world. Here is the unfair thing: most of the air pollution is generated by developed countries, and at the same time, they quickly accumulate wealth. When the consequences of pollution come, the developed countries isolate themselves from other poorer places and make the latter suffer more. It’s repugnant but it is true. The negative consequences of climate change have already fallen on the youth generation. We cannot pass it on to generations as heirlooms. We cannot let future generations pay for our mistakes either. We have no time to hesitate and we have to take action right now to stop global warming and make our offspring a better place to live.

The lectures “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” were very influential for me, as they allowed me to realize just how much impact our capitalistic society has had on the planet as a whole. The cigarette analogy really struck me, since I had never thought about how unjust the issue of anthropogenic climate change truly is. Just as Ken explained, only 1/8 of the entire population of Earth's actions were primarily responsible for the heating of the Earth, yet these are the individuals that will be mostly protected from the effects of their actions. Our American society has become heavily reliant on fossil fuels to live as we do, and we are only inflicting more damage as we do nothing to change our consumerist habits. Within the past 60 years, the people in power have created a problem that will persist for many generations to come. This video was a huge wake up call for me and it has truly opened my eyes to the injustices that underlie even environmental issues like climate change. I realize now that inequality is not only a social issue, it has become an environmental one as well. I am relieved that my generation is becoming more aware of the issue and have hope that we can change our actions that contribute to the excessive burning of fossil fuels.

I completely agree with you Michelle Bogart, the lectures “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” were very influential and inspiring. I have hope for our generation, since we are becoming more aware of how bad we are treating our planet. Our generation makes me believe that we can repair the damage that the previous generations have caused to our planet. It is nice to know that we are standing up for this because we want a future for ourselves and for future generations. I do not want future generations to worry so much about our planet. It is scary to think about sea- level rise and more severe weather tragedies. The next generation does not deserve this and I do not want them to feel like they need to clean up after our messes. We need to take care of our planet so it can maintain itself.

<br><br><hr><br>
I strongly agree and relate to your comment! The cigarette analogy also struck me and helped me understand the impact and the point that was trying to be made. Realizing that only a section of the world is truly responsible for the anthropogenic climate change also caused me to realize how much injustice there truly is and that people in our generation are trying to combat it to create a better future for those generations to come.

I believe that denial is a huge reason as to why the generation before us neglected to take care of the planet. They didn't see the effects right away or at firsthand so they refused to acknowledge the threat awaiting them. Also, for those that did foresee the threat and didn't do anything, they remained in denial of the information they received. I just think it was extremely selfish of the previous generation to take advantage of the Earth as if they had dominion over it. They definitely maintained an Anthropocentric viewpoint. I think especially in America, having Christianity as the most dominant religion in the region further drills that type of viewpoint. We are all so "trained" to live in this type of system that it seems hard to break the chain. However, I feel that my generation has become extremely aware of this system and the ways its affects us, and now we are standing up for ourselves in ways that previous generations never could. Honestly, I felt very emotional after watching these two videos because for so long I've felt like people born in the previous generations always ignored the problems they've laid out on the table for us, but there are people like you who are acknowledging the mistakes that their generation has made on behalf of that whole generation. It was nice to finally see someone from that generation take a stand and say something because I feel like it takes a lot for people to even do that. So I applaud you for being able to confront the intergenerational injustice that has occurred with full acknowledgement. I've experienced many older generational people completely shut down and deny that they made any mistakes, and have had them tell me that it was my generations fault that it was happening, which is frustrating when all we're trying to do is fix the massive absurd mess that their generation has handed down to us. All in all these videos were extremely affirming for me, and I enjoyed watching them.

The fact that the amount of carbon dioxide increased by 100ppm just with 60 years is something I was really intrigued by. When taught about how much carbon dioxide is in the air, we are usually told to look as far as the Industrial Revolution. There is no denying that it has been increased since then, but the exploitation of fossil fuels within 60 years causing a rise in CO2 that’s 3x worse than in the previous centuries makes me feel that we should emphasize this period of time more than we emphasize the centuries before (not saying we should disregard them completely). It’s interesting that many boomers seem hostile when faced with the reality of climate change. They’ll deny it even exists, yet their generation is a large part of the reason why we’re in a bad position now.  Americans in general are the same way in my opinion. We are a big contributor yet most American politicians (and a good majority of citizens) will deny it or they’ll blame other countries that actually don’t even have nearly as large of a carbon footprint. 
<br><br>
The most depressing part about this footprint is how much it’ll affect poorer countries in future generations. 3 billion only contributing to 5% of the carbon in the atmosphere is something that the U.S should really reflect on when blaming other countries. When it comes to climate change being a generational thing, it’s cool to see how progressional millennials and gen z are. It’s extremely tough to attempt to advocate for change when the people in charge are a lot older and oftentimes coming from the generation that began to heavily exploit fossil fuels in the first place. Greta Thunberg is constantly criticized by adults to the point it’s bullying. Newer generations being more aware and more likely to take a stand means people from older generations attempting to tear us down (except Ken, thanks Ken). So, it’s important for us to be both politically and environmentally active, and we also have to make sure we implement changes in our lifestyles that help reduce the effects of climate change. Because the reality is that, if we don’t implement change, we’ll have disastrous effects waiting at future generations door, making us no different from older generations.

These lectures showed us how the climate crisis was brought about within the last lifetime. The issue with this is that the generation that led our planet to this position still holds most of the power around the world. This generational problem is not over -- it is still very much an issue. In the past years, even when the climate crisis began to gain attention, very little has been done to make a change. The US, one of the most powerful countries on the planet, isn't even in the Paris Climate Agreement. That is unbelievable to me. All it does is show the world that we are still willing to pump out fossil fuels, despite knowing the effect it has on the environment. It shows that we don't listen to our own advice that we preach to developing countries. The main thing that can solve this generational issue is time, which we don't have much of. These next few years need to be filled with lots of demand from our generation for change regarding environmental policies. Without this, we may get stuck in a cycle of environmental policies being enacted just to be torn down in a few years.

The earth is 4.543 billion years old, and with the tiniest fraction of time that humans have been on it, we’ve created so much destruction. In one single lifetime, we’ve caused glaciers to melt by miles, and have polluted the air with a devastating amount of greenhouse gases. It is frightening to think that the next generations may live in a completely different world, in a  dystopia of a dying earth that is unable to support the life within it. Creating so much damage in that time, and knowing we can double it throughout the next couple of years if we do not make changes is shocking. It was interesting to find out that America makes up a majority of the pollution that contributes to climate change, but we make up only 4% of the world’s population. The planet is in a state of emergency and our generation does not understand the seriousness of it. While people are slowly becoming aware of climate change and the lifestyle changes we can make to fix it, it is obvious that certain things are habits. At the end of the video, you addressed this problem, and how some people especially those in America have become accustomed to certain lifestyles, and while I do carry the hope that we can attempt to alter those habits, will that be enough?

It is astonishing that humanity has managed to drastically change the environment in such a short period of time compared to other species. We, as a species, grew heavily dependent on fossil fuels to manage difficult tasks and make aspects of life more efficient. I have to agree that there is this generational debt that we have been building up and the only people that will suffer from this will be the future generations to come. To top it off, this generation and future generations have grown up in a place where technology is part of everyday life so we have been socialized into thinking that all of these carbon powered technologies are essential to human life. The reality of it all is that we need to find other efficient alternatives that don’t damage the planet or go back to a way of living that depends less on carbon fuels. The sad reality of this is that humanity has become so dependent on technology that we won’t cut back on our fossil fuel consumption. Overall, this issue of climate change is aa generational issue that has been passed down for this generation to figure out before we risk losing life on earth.

<p>
I worry that we are reaching the peak of our developed world. This is the first time that climate change posed a significant threat due to our own actions. Like the fall of many other civilizations, it was due to something unknown and unexpected. However, we do still have the chance to combat this, as we have all the tangible evidence of this crisis. I don't blame the older generations to be the sole fault of this conflict, as I can see that it's a smaller group of individuals that truly instigate the slowdown of a policy change towards the climate crisis. The industrial revolution brought us great advances in our society, making me believe that these advances will evolve towards helping in combating climate change.
</p><hr>

<p>
It's actually really annoying and heartbreaking to see how climate change has become a generational issue. The fact that the climate was already starting to be affected in earlier generations, and no one did anything about it is heartbreaking. And now here we are left trying to salvage whatever we can, while hoping that later generations will get the chance to experience things like going outside and smelling fresh air while being surrounded by nature. I also find it extremely frustrating to see that the people from earlier generations refuse to do anything about he crisis we're facing, and yet continue to prevent and major moves to be made. Rather they stay in the background accepting fossil fuel money, and preventing actual progress from being made, and that is upsetting. Also in the video "How the climate crisis was brought in a single lifetime" Professor Hiltner makes a statement about how the US contributes over a quarter of CO2 into the atmosphere, and that fact is so scary. How can one country, not even more than 4 percent of the worlds population, and yet we are able to do that much damage to the earth. My hope is that lawmakers and people in power will be able to come to the realization that we have to do something now or else there really will be no way to recover.
</p><hr>

<p>
The first problem that Professor Hiltner mentions is that people along the way did not believe that there would be any consequences for their actions. The reason for this can be compared to dripping oils into a well. Doing this, you can almost immediately see its affect with poisoning the water. However, it takes much longer to see the effect of releasing CO2 into the atmosphere and we really don’t see the results our actions right away. Professor says “There will be a significant time delay before the consequences are felt.” I believe that is the primary reason people don’t think their actions have a direct correlation to climate changes. I thought that his example with smoking was really powerful. He said that image you could smoke cigarettes all day every day without any negative health side affects. However, your child and every other child would experience and have to deal with it all. This is a great way to explain to people that if they don’t want to make changes for themselves, make it for their children. How is it fair that billions of people, animals, plants that will be born in the future generations have to deal with problems that they had nothing to do with. 1/4 of the CO2 in the atmosphere is from just the United States when we are only 4 percent of the worlds population.

<p>
Although most of the greenhouse emission is from developed countries, all people, especially people living poorer areas, suffer more from climate crisis. Developed counties rely too much on fossil fuels to increase their economies, but apparently almost none of them use some of the economies increased to purify the emission. It is kind of unfair for people living in poorer areas since they emit only a small part of the greenhouse gases, but they still have to suffer from such a horrible climate change. I think it is every country’s responsibility to purify what they have emitted. The consequence of climate crisis could be irreversible, which could eventually leading to another mass extinction because earth needs to reset herself. In order to let our offsprings enjoy a better earth environment, it is necessary for everyone to be aware of the seriousness of saving the environment.
</p><hr>

<p>
Professor Hiltner's example of cigarette smoking is very accurate to the CO2 issue. Cigarette smoking only affects our descendants in gene aspect but also affect them immediately in life. More than half of the harmful effect of Cigarette smoking is caused by secondhand smoke. How similar to the CO2 issue. 
<br><br>
The CO2 is caused by the wants of profit and extravagant lifestyle, the same as cigarette smoking which is not a necessary good but the smoker can not leave it. This is the most dangerous part of the CO2 issue--- it accelerates to be worse.  As the professor said, 3 quarters of CO2 are generated in recent 60 years. The old people who have the extravagant lifestyle still can live a long time and young people who grow with the extravagant lifestyle will make the CO2 issue worse. Even the 3 billion poor people who desire a better life quality will also make CO2 issues worse when they become richer. People always pursuit a better lifestyle, this is human nature. Thus, the current situation is not the biggest problem. The unchangeable lifestyle will cause a bigger CO2 issue in the future. This is why we need to educate the kids about abstinence and caring for the world.

<p>
What’s unthinkable to me is that an entire generation is responsible for the climate crisis. Once they pass away the younger generations are the ones who have to deal with the severe damage. The younger generations are the ones who have to find a solution and clean up their mess. What is even more upsetting to me is that many in the generation responsible for climate change still lives the same way they did in the past and aren’t attempting to make any changes that would help out the future and current generations. 
<br><br>
I really respect people like professor Ken, who apologizes for the mistakes their generation made. He is working hard to make a change and to inform people of the crisis we are facing. Unlike some other people from his generation he isn’t acting like climate change is a hoax, he is owning up to the mistakes that were made in the past. 
<br><br>
I’m scared for my children and grandchildren. I’m afraid to bring children into what may become an uninhabitable world. Future generations are going to hear stories of what the Earth was like before humans destroyed it. They are going to hear all about the animals that existed before we killed them off. 
<br><br>
It’s really sad that we are destroying the Earth so quickly. There is no time for anything to adapt to the changes that we are creating. We need to make a change as soon as we can, no matter how radical it is so we can avoid the doom we are heading towards.
</p><hr>

<p>
I agree with Ken that human beings keep telling themselves that there is no worries about climate change but actually the problem is disastrous. Every decision we make daily all have consequences that will influence many generations including our children and grandchildren. 
<br><br>
We are burning too many fossil fuels that release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which causes the extinction of species and more inhabitable living environment. The data in the video was surprising: Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has changed from 280 ppm to 415 ppm, a 100 point growth. It’s hard to notice the seriousness of the problem unless we look at it at a larger scale.
<br><br>
When U.S., Europe and Russia only 4% of the overall population on earth, they contribute to 66.67% of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, while the 3% of the poorest population only contributes to 5% of the carbon dioxide but they have beard the most extreme impact of the environment. That is the problem of environmental justice. Especially after watching “before the flood”, I kept asking myself why this pattern of injustice has been there for decades without appropriate adjustment? What shall we do for our future generations’ lives? 
<br><br>
Environmental problem shall firstly be valued and discussed among the public. The power of people can change the people holding the power to make decisions or changes. Then the justice of environment and country can provoke people’s thinkings. We can do more than basically apologizing to our future generations but to change our everyday routines to environmental-friendly ones. Aggregating more people to vote for public policies towards the environment will be a powerful way to help improve the situation.
</p><hr>

<p>
To believe that our economic benefits and desires control the fate of our planet is mind-boggling. But as the fossil fuel industry has continued to play a role in the cheap energy we consume, as well as the politicians that we elect and, the fact of the matter becomes much more apparent: we care about money more than we care about our planet. Professor Hiltner’s lecture snippet which records the fact that in his lifetime, the PPM within our planet has since increased by 100, is absolutely ridiculous. Yet, the reality of the situation is the idea of cheap energy invigorates business owners to make a quick buck out of a resource that is continuously causing detrimental harm to our planet. Even if a fourth of those emissions are being offset by the absorption of carbon dioxide within our oceans, those ramifications will be felt in the future. What makes this even worse, however, is that Professor Hiltner had to state an apology from his generation, as well as to the next, because of the damage they have done to our planet. Yet, this apology may be premature. In the last decade, our temperatures and climates have only grown, with increasing amounts of natural disasters, such as wildfires, hurricanes, and tornadoes, due to the ever-pressing issue of climate change. Our generation has continued to cause activism, with images such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Greta Thunberg as faces of the climate change movement. Yet, activism is not enough. Policymakers and billion-dollar corporations run the show, and without their change in process, our planet will die.

<p>
The video tells the audience that CO2 is not similar to gasoline which will be noticed immediately if it is dropped into water, because it will not detected by people because it does not influence human's normal life now, but it will impact their descendant. Moreover, it will severe consequence on human life by not only rising sea level, but also causing lots of lives go to extinction. In the video, Hiltner utilized cigarettes as an example to illustrate how the CO2 emission impact people in the future. He pointed out that a person who smokes lots cigarettes everyday, and it will influence sons and grandsons. CO2 emission is the same thing but will impact more people since it will next generation, even whole lives in the Earth. However, climate change can be mitigated if we take action from now. 
<br><br>
     Additionally, US, Russia, and Europe produced 66.7% of World CO2 emission. However, developing countries, which produce much less CO2, but will suffer more from the climate change since they can not protect them effectively. It is not fair to the developing countries. Especially, the US produce lots of CO2 which is quarter of World CO2 emission. 
<br><Br>
     Hiltner also mentioned that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased so fast by showing CO2 has increased 100 ppm during one generation. Furthermore, although people have noticed what they have done producing lots of CO2 and causing climate change, but they still drill oil and burn fossil fuel. In addition, he expressed great sorrow, because his generation has produced lots of CO2 and they also teach their children to act like them rather than innovating renewable energy.
</p><hr>

<p>
In Hiltner's lecture, "The climate crisis as a generational issue",  Hiltner talks about climate change being an analogy for smoking cigarettes. He argues that even if you could smoke 4-5 packs of cigarettes for decades with no consequences, all of your future kids and grandkids will still suffer the consequences of you smoking around them. For climate change, the immediate analogy is even if your actions that are contributing to fossil fuel burning are not deemed harmful, over time you will make your kids suffer by putting them out in an unhealthier world that is unnaturally warm and has toxic levels of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere. The overall goal according to Hiltner seems to be to leave the world in a similar or better place than we left it for the next generation to grow and develop. Unfortunately, since our ocean levels have risen to dangerous proportions and the global weather has been constantly rising, the future for our generation is looking a bit bleak. One huge issue is companies that are profiting majorly off of fossil fuel consumption (such as gas stations and fracking companies). Since their entire economy relies solely upon burning fossil fuels or exporting them they refuse to cut back on production because the company would lose money doing so. Therefore, all these different companies simply cannot stop sending tons of Carbon Dioxide smog into the atmosphere by fueling our automobiles and their factories. Now we have grown in a world that is accustomed to using fossil fuels for convenience. Since we've been ignoring the side effects of living such a comfortable lifestyle, our generation and the one after us will most likely feel the consequences of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.
</p><hr>


<p>
Climate change was brought upon by one generation but it is now up to everyone to do their part and help out. It is unfair that countries like the United States have contributed to climate change by 25% and places with lower economic stability are paying the price. People in countries that are causing the most destruction should wake up and start helping. Start cleaning up and try fixing the mistakes of past generations. The next generation symbolizes a brand new beginning and hope to do better and be better. It was shocking hearing that climate change was brought up by one generation. However, if one generation caused it, maybe it requires one generation to start the movement to live a better and cleaner life. The world is unfair but instead of appointing blame we should all take action and move forward. It is inspiring to see that the message of doing better is already being done by younger generations. There is a saying that those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. We were taught to live and consume like the past generation that caused it. But now we need to learn from their mistakes to live a better and cleaner life. One that will not allow the next generation to come, be expected to clean up our mess.
</p><hr>

<p>
I think the video is instructive as it addresses several questions of why people are not acting even when the issue of climate crisis has already been so severe. Ken explains that the delay of the negative effects of an action plays an important role in this. If we say this is a factor time-wise, then place-wise would be related to the issue of environmental justice -- people in the "developed world" are the major polluters, whereas people in the "third world" suffer even more. Just like the president of Palau said in Leonardo's Before the Flood: “The small island nations who contribute the least to the process of climate change are actually going to feel the worst impacts, the worst, because of global warming.” If people are going to solely focus on their self-interest, then the issue of climate crisis is unlikely to be addressed. I also think this Ken's use of the example of cigarettes is an effective and illustrative analogy.
<br><br>
The two contrasting pictures showing the kid in developed and developing countries are compelling as I feel poor for the kids grabbing the used toy on the floor and wish more kids could have the beautiful childhood shown in the other kid's scene. This needs everyone's efforts. For those of us who are privileged to enjoy the quality life and upper education we have, we probably have more responsibility to try our best to absorb the physical and educational "nutrients" that are available to us so that we can have stronger power to make the poor's life better off.
</p><hr>

<p>
While Ken apologizes for his generation's creation of the climate crisis, his cigarete analogy depicts how this crisis could have been brought about by anyone. By human nature, a people's detachment from the ultimate consequences of climate change lessens the intensity of the threat for them. If smoking cigarettes won't have consequences in the short-term, then that gives less reason to pay mind to the long-term consequences: the suffering of future generations. 
<br><br>
At the same time, this isn't a reason to vindicate anybody: as Ken says, people have known about the consequences of fossil fuel emissions for decades. It was a conscious choice for those in the last lifetime to continue business as usual. And it wasn't just normal human activity -- the fact that Americans, about 4% of the world population, emitted 5x as much CO2 as the poorest 3 billion people in the world, nearly 50% of the population, shows a conscious abuse of the planet by corporate interests.
</p><hr>

<p>
Professor Ken talks about why some people don’t regard climate change as a problem or crisis. Unlike most crisis we have seen, the emission of carbon dioxide would not cause any dramatic effect at first. But just like smoking, which may eventually cause lung cancer, or even generations of people, the increasing amount of greenhouse gas will ultimately lead to the collapse of earth. Therefore, it is significant to not only inform the old generation about what they have done but also educate the new generation to be conscious about climate change. By appealing to emotions to those people who are dealing damages to the earth, Ken is trying to help the old generation correct the mistakes they have done. And, for our generation, we still have time and chance to make some difference. Moreover, what important is making action, such as spread the idea to people surround you and live a sustainable life. Although the climate crisis is mainly reflecting on other species and poor region, it will eventually fall on everybody. Therefore, both for us and for the future, a more sustainable life is necessary and inevitable.
</p><hr>

<p>
The climate crisis has indeed been brought upon by the people in the the centuries before my current generation, this is troubling. However, I will not place full blame on a generation of people because of the choices the decided to make in regard to the future population of the planet. When presented with the fact that the U.S. accounts for only 4% of the population of Earth, yet we emit nearly a quarter of all of the C02 in the atmosphere. That is an astonishing statistic. For this reason I believe that blame has to stop being placed on previous generations, yes they contributed and caused climate change but arguing about what they have done is beyond the scope of what needs to be done currently. I am pleased that our current generation has already started to fight politicians and lead figures against the climate change fight. This is where the focus of climate change should centered. The arguments may state that past ancestors and previous generations started the problem, but we need to be the beginning of the end of climate change if we wish to better our children and their ancestors. Activism is a step in the right direction as Professor Hiltner says, he hopes that people support what our generation is doing, as they should. Though it may take time I believe the increased action and realization and recognition that we and other well developed are largely responsible for the climate issues will allow the populations of these places to make the changes necessary to keep the human race alive, and thriving. Professor Hiltner says in the beginning and end of his lecture that there is still time and although the actions needed to create the change necessary may sound drastic, without a change there will be no Earth that is fit for a human race.
</p><hr>

<p>
The two lectures talk about how the climate crisis is caused and why it matters to us. Ken also discusses that the last generation has mostly caused the crisis, which has delayed effects on our generation and even the future generation. It is true that the amount of CO2 releasing to the planet was dramatically large in the last century and continually rose, which made the planet become unwelcoming and even uninhabitable now. However, I think the situation is tricky and controversial. 
<br><br>
On the one hand, I believe that parents’ generation should not ascribe all the fault to themselves and in my opinion, it is the fault of all generations. I can fully understand the needs of burning fossil fuels for the last century since the technology was not that advanced and the world needs the development and breakthroughs in industries and the economy. These needs forced the increasing amount of burning fossil fuels, which leads to a substantial release of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. With the progress people made and the increasing population, pollution to atmosphere and harm to climate aggravate. Moreover, except needs and force, underdeveloped technologies and incomplete understanding and knowledge toward climate and environment may limit people’s view to the future and thus, making the process of detecting climate and predicting possible consequences and influences hard. In this case, although the last generation is the one who largely burned fossil fuels, the actions are mostly for future development and social needs. Our generation is taking advantage of what they have done. We should not judge them so strictly.
<br><br>
One the other hand, I admit that it is unfair for people on poverty or low social status to suffer the consequences of climate crisis since they, around 3 billion people, have just contributed 5% of the CO2 in the atmosphere. It is quite ironic and people who live better should reflect and take actions. 
<br><br>
But it is not the main point here to find who is the culprit of releasing greenhouse gases and causing the climate crisis. Finding solutions to mitigate the situation and solving the problems are the main things we need to work and deal with. It is necessary and pressing for all generations to make actions and protect our earth. Everyone should admit how severe the issue is and how urgent the answer is. It is time to fix it and it is still not late.
<br><br>
(It is all from my own perspectives. Welcome for opinions and arguments.)

<p>
It is crucial that climate crisis is a lock effect which will influences not only the conductors themselves, but also their decedents, friends, people around them, as well as the eco system. This is extremely important, because it can be a vital reason for us to actually start to protect the environment, since it is related to our daily life, and it will probably hurt people we care about.  
<br><br>
I was really touched and depressed that when Ken is making the apology. I think it is really admirable, because huge amounts of people would just say that they are just doing what others do, so climate change is not their fault, or not just their fault, because it can be stopped if only them changing their way of life. However, we have to apologize for the environment, for the earth that we, human, make our home worse, and we are not able to change, or persuade our companions to change it yet.
</p><hr>

<p>
I find it incredible that the the most advanced nation in the world, the US, is the country that is doing the most damage. For all our engineering achievements and different discoveries, we have failed to alter the most important part of society. It is now up to our leaders to remedy this issue. Our generation must be the ones leading the change as it us and our future children that will be the ones who have to insert for the problems. The data provided in this lecture is scary, and I fail to understand why people still deny the very noticeable changes. In this age of social media, it is very easy to spread fake news and disseminate misinformation, so we must be wary to avoid it. Instead, we should be using social media to encourage change and spread new ideas. We  must act now before the issues progresses even more.
</p><hr>


<p>
We as humans have a bad tendency to “sweep it under the rug” and let our problems be someone else’s, and this behavior of ours when it comes to the industrialization has left quite a big mess underneath the carpet. But it would not be our parents that will clean up our mess, but the future generation, our kids, that will have to deal with it. Funny how the people we were supposed to protect now have to face the consequences of our actions. Ken also made a connection in this video that really hit home for me. He stated how the industrialized countries are the main contributors to the production of carbon dioxide even though they do not hold much of the population, while the rest of the world, “3 billion other people”, the ones in less developed countries, have to suffer the same consequences as us. What even more ironic is that we as a richer country can negate some of the results of climate change with our wealth and tech, while the pooer ones have to face them head-on. The injustice is unreal.

I definitely agree that we tend to let our problems become someone else's. As you and Ken mention, the majority of the worst effects of climate change will be left for future generations to cope with, and I think a main reason that it is so easy for us to delay action is that we do not have children yet. Some of us may not even want children (especially due to the uninhabitable or unwelcoming earth they may face), so it is difficult to act selflessly to help a generation that does not yet exist. On the same note, since we live in a developed country that has resources to partially cope with an unwelcoming earth, it is not only injustice, but further motivation to continue the same selfish actions that are driving the earth closer to being uninhabitable.
<br><br>
I worry that the generations alive today will not be able to put their own desires aside to make the drastic changes necessary to combat climate change, but I agree with Ken that it is very good that the youth are speaking out against the older generations that supported the fossil fuel industries enough to lead us to this point. This means that we know how it feels to deal with a mess that we did not create and should be more inclined to not want to leave that same mess to the future.

<p>
In the first lecture video, " the climate crisis is a generational issue", he personally expressed the anger of young generations toward the previous generation since they did not take any action. As what Ken has mentioned, the past generation has left earth which is already in a severe problem. Moreover, I was also shocked by how terrible that CO2 has deeply affected our environment. Besides, I really appreciate his analogy of using the cigarette scenario because it made everything much more easier to comprehend. Throughout this analogy, we could easily understand the effect of climate change and how it affects our future children and grandchildren. Ken also illustrated that poverty has played a negative role in this crisis mess. So I believe we should try our best to make our homeland a better place to live and reduce unnecessary emission such as CO2 or other.

"The Climate crisis as a generational issue" and "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" both discuss how the climate crisis was rooted deep in history, however its effects can only be seen in current day. The comparison between smoking cigarettes and seeing a build up of smoke is a great one to show the way CO2 builds up in the atmosphere, and the way that the children of the cigarette smokers will feel the affect is exactly like the way the future generations will feel the worst of the effects simply by being born into them. Just in the way that this is unfair to leave our problems with generations that had nothing to do with them, it is even more immoral that the 3 billion poorest countries who only produce 5% of the CO2 in the atmosphere will feel the most detrimental effects and will not have the buffer the first world countries do. I see how a lot of the climate crisis revolves around money and the lack of funding for the environment, as well as the funding of corrupt industries that continue to be hazardous to the environment and intern all the living species and human population.
<br><br>
You can see Ben's pain and shame when discussing the scarcity of action in his generation, I do not want to be in the same place when I am 60. I want to have felt like my generation was the change and I was a part of it. I want to be proud of the strides we took and not wished to have done more. In the end, we are in control of how much of this we allow to go on, and in turn the destiny of ourselves and the future generations to come. Just like the smoker may eventually die from smoking too many cigarettes, our earth will die if we continue to harm it in the way we are now. It is only fair that we respect it, and the life it has given us. As it continues to provide, we must give back rather than take, I think this mentality could help change the view of those who don't understand the climate crisis, and necessity for action.

I completely agree with you. I hope that when I am sixty, I want to be proud of our generation's accomplishments in mediating the effects of climate change. In the future, I want to see  the world greener then it is now. I want for our generation to be the ones leading the charge in the environmental crisis that we are in. With less fossil fuels being burned and more renewable energy being used, I hope that my generation sees my vision of a better and greener future. I want to see a world where everyone strives  to reduce their waste, rather than a world  being dominated by waste.

I find it insane that this entire global climate crisis was developed in one single lifetime. While people of that generation were the root of this crisis and kicked off our contribution to climate change, I do admire that many individuals, no matter what generation they are a part of, are turning a corner and joining the fight to save our planet and break the cycle that involves consistently abusing it. Professor Hiltner apologizes on behalf of his generation because they created this cycle which harms our earth. He apologizes for not only leaving us with a planet that is uninhabitable but raising their children to make the same mistakes. We have inherited their fossil fuel addiction. He also mentions the reason for our path to devastation. The fact that this problem has a time-delay on consequences allowed one generation to enjoy the benefits and now many will face the repercussions. 
<br><br>
It is also horrible to think about how the wealthiest countries that add the most carbon into our atmosphere will be able to use their fossil fuel money to insulate themselves when disaster strikes. While, countries with little money will experience the most extreme consequences.
</p><hr>

<p>
Starting off this class with this 12 minute lecture sets the tone that is to come for the class. There are positive and negative ways to look at climate change and the means that it can be dealt with. Hiltner's use of cigarette smoking as an analogy for what climate change is doing to our Earth gives an easy to understand view while showing that change can be made when everyone is able to come together and realize the facts at hand. Yet smoking is still a thing in our society today with its known hazards so what does this mean for fossil fuels in our future? Countries know the harms that fossil fuels cause to our planet, but our unlike our addiction with that of smoking the computation of fossil fuels is far greater than people want to admit. It is not hard to understand that places like the U.S produces some of the most pollution on the planet compared to poorer countries of our world because of urbanized consumption habits. With my generation still not being taken seriously about the issues of climate change because of the older generational people in power but it being talked about on a daily basis is deeply upsetting. To hear Hiltner's apology felt genuine and was accepted because I understand that people have been trying to protect our planet and make others aware me and lots of other people in my generation.

<p>
The Climate Crisis is Generational Issue is a very great interpretation into how our generation is trying to combat climate change basically all on our own. It’s actually sad to think that we have constantly willingly trashed our planet, and how after years and years of carelessness the effects are starting to be felt. We have done this to ourselves, and now I feel like our generation is left with the burden to fix a problem that has been brewing long before we were even alive. I found the cigarette example very eye opening because I think we all fail to realize the effects of our actions when we aren’t immediately punished. And that is the way climate change is. The lecture just also made me upset because people before us and even older people now don’t even care about what they’re doing because they won’t have to experience any of its effects. I feel like overall we were just left with a bad situation and we are finally going to have to be the ones to do something about it if we want future generations to survive.
</p><hr>

<p>
I personally don’t blame older generations for the climate crisis that we have today. We are raised and taught to believe different things today than what older generations learned from their parents and in school. It was not as talked about then and there weren’t as many resources to learn more about it. I would even argue and say that if anything, our generation is at fault because only so many people speak out about global warming yet we have been taught about the climate crisis in schools and see it all over the media. Professor Hiltner also talked about the time lag between the cause and the effect that carbon dioxide has on the planet and that we are really starting to understand those effects today because of increased wildfires and hurricanes. Previous generations were not as exposed to this, which, again, makes me think that they don’t deserve all the blame. With the current political climate, I would say that the biggest problem is the absence of governmental leaders willing to address the severity of the climate crisis and act on it. Many people look to these politicians for answers and the fact that current leaders are turning away from this issue is wrong. There have been many climate change protests around the world and even in Santa Barbara so I don’t think that the reason politicians turn their heads is because of a lack of constituent support. I think that the problem is because of corporations and the powerful people behind those corporations that donate millions in order to ensure that politicians don’t acknowledge climate change so that their fossil fuel businesses will continue to thrive.
<br><br>
Furthermore, it is disheartening to see how people in the developing world are subject to some of the worst effects of climate change and have little means to help themselves. Especially considering the fact that they aren’t at fault for releasing the excess carbon dioxide that created the problem in the first place. The United States specifically continues to thrive and increase its wealth by selfishly destroying the environment and, yet, people look at the U.S. as a role model. If the United States truly wants to lead the world in prosperity, we need to get rid of our bad habits and mitigate global warming.

<p>
In his lecture, ‘the climate crisis as a generational issue’ is accurately sum up the issues that our generation faces. He mentioned in his video that not only your children but your grandchildren and moreover every subsequent generation of your descendants for hundreds of years. Every child born on the planet for the next few hundreds years would suffer the consequences from their entire lives. Not only would subsequent generations of human beings suffer for hundreds of years but all life on the planet would be profoundly impacted from the heights of the atmosphere to the depths of the ocean.
</p><hr>

<p>
To think that the climate crisis of today was primarily caused by only 60 years of human actions is mind-blowing, in addition to petrifying (during one of our lectures Ken said that we should not feel petrified about the climate crisis. I disagree). As the baby boomer generation nears its end, the millennial generation and generation Z will soon be responsible for the fossil fuel-induced mess that the baby boomers are leaving behind. 
<br><br>
Most of us (us being my generation) like to say that the older generations are resistant to change and possess the fossil fuel addiction that Ken elaborated on in the video. We criticize them for the technologies and systems that play a big part in the growing percentage of CO2 in our atmosphere, the melting of our ice caps, the depletion of our food and water resources, etc. However, I wonder how many of us actually are going through the steps to help reduce our impact on the planet. On social media platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook, people like to share posts/stories that are highlighting various environmental crises happening around the world while expressing their thoughts and sympathies. But who actually is changing their environmental habits? People will comment on articles about how vehicles and factory emissions are exponentially increasing the amount of CO2 in our air. How many of them will actually stop or limit using gas-powered cars, airplanes, or factory-created products, rather than continue to use them for their "convenience?" Accounts regularly post about how electricity is increasing the consumption of fossil fuels, leading to more CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. How many of the people liking and sharing these posts will actually restrict their use of smartphones, computers, tablets, video game consoles, and other electronics? Likewise to posts talking about the (HUGE) impact of meat-filled diets on different parts of our ecosystem. And once again, how many of the people engaging in that post will actually stick to a plant-based diet, rather than sticking to their old habits? 
<br><br>
At this point in time, it is up to the current generation, my generation, to deal with the consequences of the previous generations' indifference and ignorance towards the health of our one and only planet. How fair this may or may not be is not of utmost importance now. Instead of blaming each other and causing even more conflict about the climate crisis, it is crucial that our generations work TOGETHER to come up with viable solutions that will reduce the drastic effects of human actions on Earth.
</p><hr>


<p>
It is sad that Ken's generation have made human and other species' only inhabitant uninhabitable. Yet, majority of this group refuse to believe climate crisis is a thing because of the delay of the effect cause by these people. More sadly, as Ken said in video, these people also taught their kids to adopt same lifestyle which will continuously harm this planet. And these people, mostly came from developed countries, only occupied 1/8 of population while contributing to world's 2/3 of CO2 emission. This is insanely unfair and we must stand up and fight our own future. With that being said, I am not optimistic about any change as we are relying on and addicted to fossil fuel. It just make life more desirable. Thus, I believe that I will see Earth became an entire mess in my lifetime.
</p><hr>

<p>
It is shocking to see how true of a generational issue this is.  This is astounding generational injustice and it is amazing the vast impact of our fossil fuel usage in such a short amount of time, relatively speaking.  Also, it is sad to see that after one generation of bad habits and practices, mine and future generations are left to suffer and attempt to clean up the mess of another generation.  The climate crisis is being passed down, but even now, there are still those who continue their harmful habits and are continuing to worsen the issue that many are trying to solve, or at least reduce the impact we have.
</p><hr>

<p>
It is hard to believe that not even 100 years ago our carbon levels were 100 ppm lower than they are today. Before this video I understood that the United States contributes a lot of fossil fuel and carbon emission into the atmosphere but I was unaware that they contribute 45% of it. I believe yes that a large majority of fossil fuel emission may have occurred during that generation due to lack of higher technologies and proper techniques and regulations for safety and management, but I don't agree that they are the only generation to really contribute to the escalating destruction of our earth. Our generation can be to blame as well due to the corrupt fossil fuel owners who bribe media bunnies and the extreme number of cows within just the US alone. 
<br><br>
I am shocked that even after the time delay that occurred after extreme emissions of carbon, people still cannot recognize that their carbon footprint is killing the earth. Before watching this lecture I was unaware of the time delay but after learning about it I now understand the fear that it has implemented into the minds of scientists and I believe that that same fear should be implemented into the minds of US citizens especially. The United States is ignorant of their carbon footprint and even though we are more conscious than China, we still carry a negative and downgrading view of climate change and all its effects. It was painful to learn that half of the world barely contributes to the climate change but do to the overpowering nations, they are extremely affected in a negative way, sometimes more than those corrupting countries themselves. Why is it that the public still, for the most part, believes the false words of the paid, overpowering media and government officials who sugarcoat the climates true nature? I am saddened that the United States contributes 45% of carbon emissions but I am more saddened that 3 countries alone make up for 66.6% of the carbon emissions released, ruining the future lives for not only their offspring, but for the offspring of those who contribute little-to-no carbon into the earth's atmosphere.
</p><hr>

<p>
There is no doubt that there is a generational difference in how the climate crisis is viewed. I think of people like Greta Thunberg, who was mentioned in the video, and how she is providing a new take on the fight against climate change. She, along with many others, is angry at previous generations for not acting in time, even when the facts about fossil fuel pollution were in front of them. Many people in power favored economic growth and wealth over the well being of the planet, as many still do today. Our generation is constantly bombarded with the message that we are the last hope our planet has, that the time to act is now. We have been left to fight decades worth of damage and destruction, and many of us on the front lines are not even old enough to purchase alcohol. Climate protests are filled with high school and college aged kids demanding change from the older generation who still holds most of the legislative power.
<br><br>



As discussed in the “How climate change was brought about in a single lifetime” video, the poorest half of our planet’s population is responsible for only 5% of carbon emissions. The effects of climate change will be felt the most by the poorest nations, and they are the least to blame. This is simply not fair. The countries who have produced the majority of carbon emissions have a moral and ethical responsibility to make major changes to fight the climate crisis, or else billions of innocent people will suffer (and many already are).
</p><hr>

<p>
In the first lecture video, “The climate crisis as a generational issue”, Professor Hiltner shows the segments of youth protesting and asking for awareness of climate change as many youth are upset at the older generation as the belief is that the older generation is responsible with the speeding up of the earth’s inability to sustain life. I do believe that my parents generation is partially responsible for the increase of carbon emissions and my grandparents generation, but I also believe that my generation has also helped contribute. Although we blame the older generations we as the new generation use fossil fuels more than ever, do not have solely plant based diets, and continue to increase the total populations every day. 
<br><br>
In the second lecture video, “How the climate change was brought about in a single lifetime”, my initial reaction was that I was shocked that from just 1959 to 2019 we have increased carbon emissions by over a hundred parts per notation (ppm). I do believe that the time delay did play a huge factor in the realization of the damage of carbon emissions but the carbon emissions are still rising every year. The example from the video that I really liked was comparing cigarettes and carbon emission, as when people smoke cigarettes they assume it will be damaging to their own bodies but they do not think about their spouse, kids, guest, pets who breath in that smoke everyday and have a health problems down the road from second hand smoking. Just like cigarettes, people do not realize the impact that rising carbon emissions has on the earth, the ocean, and the entirety of the world’s population. It was not surprising though, that America, Europe, and Russia combined made up 66% of the Carbon emissions, but it is sad that the largest negative effect is typically on the third world countries who have the lowest carbon emissions.

I really agree with your opinion in the first paragraph. I think that the older generation is to blame for much of the emissions we have created. They perpetuated the concept of convenience when it comes to consuming everything: food, clothing, electricity, media, etc. I think that had some of the technology and lifestyle habits they preached gained such popularity, we might not be in as dire of a situation as we are in now. 
<br><br>
I believe that our generation is getting the brunt of it. We are the most anxious, depressed and overall unhappy generation, and this is without even considering the state of our planet. We as a generation have now realized how very real this issue is and how drastically our lives will change because of it. However, we (largely referencing those who live in developed countries) do benefit from detrimental practices that early generations set in place such as fast fashion, high consumption of animal products, and single-use products out of convenience. I think that if we want to truly help ourselves (even though it might not be as much as we would hope) we must call on our peers to engage in the systemic change we need. We cannot just sit in lecture halls learning about all the ways our planet is fighting back and not act.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree with Quinn in the aspect that our generation does not do all it can to be environmentally friendly. Although a significant portion of the blame may be put on the generations before us, many people our age are still very wasteful with food, electricity, and other resources. This is partially because many people were not raised to make environmentally conscious decisions. Spreading awareness about the harsh reality of climate change to not only our generation, but to future generations can fix this issue. An effective way to do this would be to mandate all middle or high schools take an environmental studies or climate change class. By doing so, students across the nation would be more aware of the climate crisis and would be motivated to make a difference. 
<br><br>
 It is intriguing to me that Quinn brought up the comparison of smoking cigarettes to carbon emission from the  second lecture video, “How the climate change was brought about in a single lifetime”. Although Quinn chose to compare the second hand smoking effects of cigarettes to the ways carbon emissions affect other aspects of the world, a second comparison can also be made. People who smoke tons of cigarettes may not realize the negative consequences at first, as they will not encounter them until later in life. Similarly, humans cause carbon emissions at a rapid and dangerous rate because the effects are not seen until years later. Furthermore, the effects are seen worse in third world countries, which make it seem to us first world countries, like it isn’t happening to “us” and that the problem is “further away” than it is in reality. With both cigarettes and carbon emissions, once the consequences do appear, they are irreversible and destructive.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree that much of the blame can be placed upon the generations that came before us, but we still do not live as environmentally friendly as we should and there are those in our generation that do not believe in climate change. While we need to replace the older generation in public office, we also need to make sure our generation is educated so there is sweeping support of climate change initiatives. 
<br><br>
I was shocked at how such a small percentage of the world population can cause so much damage to the environment in such a small amount of time. I knew that developed countries contributed most of the CO2 emissions, but the fact that 3 billion people in poorer countries only contributed 5% is astonishing. It really is so unfair to them that they will face the worst effects of climate change even though they did not cause it.

This lecture was very informative and emotional as people such as Professor Hiltner provided us with the severity of how the older generation has done to the planet as well has his sincere apology to our generation. It is not difficult to find people such as Professor Hiltner who are aware of our planet dying, but it is rare for such people to become influencers and educators. The Global North is currently still solely attempting to profit from exploitation of not only the health of our planet but also the health of the Global South. 
<br><br>
From a more optimistic view, there are much more people in our generation who shares their ideas and actions along with Professor Hiltner. For people like Greta Thunberg and many other climate activists, they realize the severity and are striving to make a change from the above to the “below. In the lifetime of our generation (if the planet is not yet doomed), I believe we have the ability to fix, or at least slow down the damage of what mankind has done to the planet over the past centuries.

Do you think adults should feel bad while teenagers are smoking which is bad for atmosphere? Should Greta Thunberg make another speech to yell at teenagers that they should have the responsibility of helping adults protecting the Earth? In my opinion, the Earth is not only belongs to the new generation. Adults shouldn’t do everything and prepare everything well for children. The world is wild, the society is complex, so teenagers shouldn’t be that naïve. Don’t blame everything on adults. Greta Thunberg so far does nothing but talking too much, polluting, and wasting money. In China, students are forced to go to the wild and plant trees every March 12th because it is our Planting Trees’ Day. Chinese people are serious about protecting the Earth, and we are doing real things.

<br><br><hr><br>
I did not say that "adults" should feel bad about what they have done, and many are not even aware of what they are doing is bad for the planet. I am solely trying to state that the few old gen people who are promoting environmental protection along side the new gen is very respectable. Also, China has indeed done a lot for the environment upon the realization how impactful their rapid development was to nature, and I think that is very grand. But it is not like other countries are not doing anything to help the planet. For people like Greta Thunberg, you stated that she has not done anything but speeches, but you forgot who she really is: an influencer. Check out the numerous organizations and mass scale protest she has spawned across the world; it is regarded as "the Greta Effect". I am aware that to solve the climate crisis we would need to forgo billions of profit, but at least someone is taking action and not taking the money.
<br><br><hr><br>

I did not say that you said ‘adults should feel bad about what they have done’. Adults should not feel bad about what they have down. However, I agree with your words that Greta Thunberg is an ‘influencer’ which makes me nearly agree with your opinion. I think perhaps Thunberg should yell that do not be an influencer. Instead, get the hands dirty, do real things by self. Do not promote others especially as a not-grown-up. Probably promote people in her age is better than promote adults. Adults can teach their children how to protect the planet. ‘Influence’ and ‘difference’ are two very similar word in spelling and pronouncing, but they should not be considered similar actions. Try to make a difference in the world, instead of influencing each other. Unless it is influencing each other making a difference in the world.

"The climate crisis as a generational issue" lecture and the explanation of that argument in "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" lecture discusses the burden of climate change older generations have placed on younger generations, who are now forced to carry and actively solve to maintain a habitable planet for our generation and generations to come. I found it extremely telling how much we have impacted our planet through our thirst for money, power and consumerism in the last 60 years, and have been frustrated with the "inability" of people in power to drastically change their methods of production along with the resistance of people to let go of certain commodities and consumer-driven lifestyles for the benefit of the planet and future generations. It is unfortunate that we have allowed a generation to progressively become addicted to this fast-paced, short-term reward, making them blind to the long-term negative effects this lifestyle has created. 
<br><br>
I do believe that the generation of our parents and grandparents have caused these problems, however I also believe that our generation is playing the same field as them in some ways, even though we may make small changes such as reusables, recycling, not littering, etc. Being from the developed world, we have access to so much more than third world countries, such as uber/driving everywhere, millions of fast-fashion stores, "trendy" foods  that are shipped from across the world, and the constant need to buy new electronics, etc and it is clear that most of us do not want to change our ways our of convenience. These habits are damaging as well, and we can actively take more control over these habits. Along with this, it is extremely unfair that our lifestyle is brought to us by the labors of those in developing countries, who feel this crisis the most as we use their lands for trash storage and pollute their air with our factories etc., while we live in comfort. As a generation wanting to instill such drastic change, it is important that we become more aware of this as we fight for climate justice.
<br><br>
Though I believe what I said above to be true, I still place most of the blame on big corporations and politicians who use these industries to facilitate their power and increase their wealth. There will be no one to buy the products and no one to govern if we destroy our planet little by little each day, there must be a radical change in the way these people run their businesses and stimulate rapid economic growth, we must start there.

I think it's so important to look at the big corporations that have been large contributors to our world's climate crisis. It's interesting to notice that its these exact corporations and politicians that will continue to go on like nothing is happening in order to secure and protect the wealth of their company. The generation that is mostly to blame for the creation of the fast-paced lifestyle is also the generation who simply assumes that they do not need to do anything to help fix the problem because they will be gone before the damage is detrimental. As Professor Hiltner discussed in this first video, this "generational issue" is left up to the youth because they have been stuck with the implications of the increase of carbon in the atmosphere. Whether we like it or not, we are the generation that has been assigned the task of improving the way of life for our children and unfortunately, as young adults, we look up to our elders for assistance and in return, we receive statements of denial for what change is actually occurring. 
<br><br>
The lifestyle that we are all used to and the activities that we participate in, day to day, are the exact habits that are affecting not only our immediate environment but also the many developing countries that are suffering from, mainly, our mistakes. While our generation can begin to push for a change and build awareness, the generation of politicians and corporate business leaders, need to step up and realize what they have caused for the entire world and begin to make active moves towards a better future for everyone.

Wow that was a great point made about our daily habits, you're right that consumerism has led us to making purchases that are not necessarily environmentally friendly. Now I have a question for you. Do you believe that individual changes in habits, such as going vegan or recycling more, have a legitimate impact on the planet or are they simply ways to make us feel good about ourselves?

We as human beings tend to prolong problems and let someone else deal with them just like we did in the industrialization period, we allowed ourselves to pollute the air knowing eventually it would have a dramatic effect on the environment in the future. Even though Ken’s generation started the climate problem, it’s our generation that could do something in order to try and reverse what they have started. My generation, is too caught up in their own lives and so centered about what makes them look good, we can’t take anything seriously anytime an actual problem arrives we sit back and create memes or post about on social media instead of actually going out and facing the problem head-on. We say we want to make a difference, but actions speak louder that words. We put our energy into things that don’t need it, we will publicize Kim Kardashian’s large walk in fridge, but we won’t talk about the fact that our world is literally falling apart right in front our very eyes every single day, we want to blame large businesses, the rich and more when we are all to blame for what’s happening, but not everyone is ready for that conversation. Instead of trying to go “save the turtles” by buying a hydro-flask and metal straws how about we organize a beach clean-up, or instead of buying cars that are “eco- friendly” and will reduce CO2 emissions, how about you bike to work, walk, take public transportation, or even car-pool. It’s the small things that each one of us could do to really make a difference.

Professor Ken’s two lectures “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” go hand in hand with one another. In the second of the two lectures, Professor Ken discusses the rise in global CO2 emissions in the course of the past 60 years. In 1959, CO2 was held in the atmosphere at 315ppm. In present day, it is now held at 415ppm. He emphasizes how three quarters of the most significant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere has been emitted by human beings in one lifetime, his lifetime. This is a global problem which affects the entire human race, along with marine life, insects, and other species which inhabit the planet. Oceans absorb unprecedented quantities of CO2 which pose extreme threats to species that depend on ocean waters for shelter, food, and ultimately  life. I like how the professor made the United States’ role in the climate crisis clear and evident. Despite comprising ~4% of the world’s population, the U.S. is a leading contributor to CO2 emissions. On the other hand, individuals resigns in developing countries are suffering in present day and generations to come, even though they have not contributed to global CO2 emissions on a wide scale. 
<br><br>
Professor Ken also includes an analogy centered around the detrimental potential that one individual encapsulates on the planet. The analogy of the impact of  that 1 in 8 people smoking cigarettes  will cause enough turmoil for the offspring of humans around the globe. All life on the plant, ranging from the atmosphere to the oceans,  would suffer from the actions of these individuals, even reaching the extremes of extinction in some cases.  Subsequent generations will ultimately suffer from the enjoyment of one lifetime.  This explains Professor Ken’s reasoning behind the time delay which of CO2 emissions that have given rise to the climate crisis. There is a significant time delay before the consequence of releasing CO2 in the atmosphere will be felt.Today and the near future represents the aftermath of the generation who failed to acknowledge the consequences of burning fossil fuels. “The climate crisis as a generational issue” reveals how youth are dealing with these consequences. For decades, previous inhabitants have failed to change the way in which they treat the planet, leaving today’s youth to rebel as an attempt to push for change.

I think Ken did a great job of summarizing our generations current issue. Decades ago, the older generations used fossil fuels and lived lifestyles they knew weren't good for our planet. It doesn't take a scientist to realize that putting harmful substances out  may cause irreversible damage. Like the point Ken made with adults smoking, every action made can influence and harm hundreds or even thousands of people. It is a rippling effect caused by those who aren't even experiencing the drastic effects. Those older people who did fight decades ago and who still fight now are admirable and I (along with many others) greatly appreciate them. 
<br><br>
Some choose to be selfish but to survive this harsh and unforgiving world we all must work together. Capitalistic ideas and money have greatly torn us apart from the apathetic side of human nature. Gas, oil, lumber, and the agricultural industries are taking over the world and using it to their advantage without a care for those negatively affected. People are letting it happen because it is "how we have always done things" but that doesn't mean it should still be happening now. These companies shouldn't have the political power that they do. 
<br><br>
Our generation is starting to fight back for the future that belongs to us because it was wrongly abused by selfish people who didn't care about the consequences we are now facing. We are the ones that will do something because we know it is right for others that we share this planet with, not just ourselves. Just like Ken said, we will fight to our last death to ensure a brighter future for those after us.

<p>
The analogy of smoking that Ken lay out to demonstrate the delay in climate change really stood out. It captured not only the health risks but also the motivation behind why the older generation didn’t feel the need to stop the using fossil fuels. As ken said one of the main contributions to why we have let this problem go on so far without taking action is the delay. The delay is what made the crisis so sever. For our grandparents, they had no idea the consequence that would come upon their grandchildren by using single use plastics, all they knew was that they were convenient and easy. Similar to the smoker, if you don’t face the consequences and there are no foreseen future repercussions why would you stop? Not only have we seen this in the past but it is a common occurrence. For example, we have only had smartphones for the past ten years, who knows the consequences that lay ahead for us using these devices. For all we know why could die from cancer due to the signal being put off by phones 24/7 but even with a worry of cancer, we continue to rely on these devises more and more. 
<br><br>
Another aspect of the video that Ken touched upon and really stood out to me was how the developed world is harming the less developed world. The harsh reality the developed countries actions are having the most drastic lasting effects on those areas that are contributing the least to the climate crisis. The people in those countries that don’t have the resources to protect themselves from the effects of climate change are going to feel it the most. This is not fair, but my question is how we use this to help up encourage those citizens who aren’t impacted but make the most impact to change their ways and support the reduction of fossil fuels and CO2 emissions.

<p>
In “How the climate crisis was brought about a single life time”, Ken pointed out that the majority of greenhouse gases was created by people from his age in United States and Europe. In contrast, people from undeveloped regions, which constitute the majority of population, only produce minimal amount of such pollution. “Poor people always suffer more” is the reality. In our world, it is a sad fact that we cannot reach the climate justice. From the internet, I learn that many developed countries will prefer to construct factories in undeveloped countries. As a result, the pollution will remain in these poor countries and hurt the local people there. In addition, Ken apologized for the outcomes that caused by his own generation. We need to think clearly about our behaviors because some changes may be created in the future. Our certain actions may seem harmless now but terrible events may happen after a long time. We need to keep this “time delay” idea in mind. Our offspring is innocent, so we need to be responsible for their future. I really hope we can find a balance between development and our environment.

I agree that climate justice does not seem like a plausible solution because there is no economic incentive in doing helping out the developing world. I mean, despite the major climate events that have occurred in recent years, many politicians and Americans in general still endorse the use of fossil fuels and such to help strengthen the profits of influential corporations even within the U.S.. It seems that the priority is to extract all the money possible from our fossil fuel driven economy no matter the cost, even at the expense of the entire population with climate change. But the difference is, like Ken mentions in the video, that developed nations will have the means, from the profit made from fossil fuels, to help protect themselves from climate change issues. Meanwhile, other countries that do not contribute to the problem will suffer.
<br><br>
Also, I think that even our generation is part of that problem. Even though many younger people are aware of the issues of climate change and they may contribute to forms of environmental activism like Greta Thunberg, most people are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels in their daily lives, excess consumption remains widespread, responsibility is placed on corporations rather than individual action, and so on. Granted, some of these aspects have been inherited from past generations, but nonetheless, I am afraid that one day we will be in the same position and feel the need to apologize for our contributions to the destruction of the planet to a future generation as well.

As stated in the first video, the climate crisis truly is a generational issue. However, the climate crisis is not only an issue of generation, but of socioeconomic injustice. The video entitled “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” highlights some of the many disparities resulting from this global climate disaster. 
<br><br>
Some of the mistakes made by earlier generations seem nearly irreversible, as these generations did not experience the consequences at the time, which is completely unfair to our generation, as we are now dealing with the repercussions of their selfish habits. While I do not believe that this generation is perfect in terms of caring for the health of the environment, it’s important to acknowledge the movement and fight for healing climate. While many of the environmental problems facing our world today did not arise from our mistakes, we still feel as if our planet is worth fighting for, and the passion seen in youth movements around the world is very inspiring.
<br><br>
Additionally, acknowledgment of injustices our climate crisis is critical. Quality of life can determine one’s ability to “escape” the risks and vulnerabilities associated with climate change, as people with more money and representation can move away from the acute issues surrounding their daily lives. Communities of color and lower income are affected disproportionately, and environmental injustice is rampant throughout the United States and around the globe. While direct environmental impacts of climate change are dangerous to our posterity, the disastrous effects of the climate crisis seen by the most vulnerable communities threaten not only their quality of life, but their survival.
</p><hr>



<p>
As the saying goes, history repeats itself; the past warned us of our future, and never have we ignored it so willingly. 4 out of the 5 mass extinctions in human history were caused by climate change, rooted in the emissions of greenhouse gases. Not only did we ignore this warning in the past, but even now, with our planet’s death approaching faster and faster, people refuse to take the issue seriously. We continue to live selfishly, taking advantage of the power that we were given by merely being on earth at all. 
<br><br> 
I believe this is partly due to the magnitude of climate change; its effects are incomprehensible, and it is next to impossible to come to terms with something that the human race—or even more significantly, no individual-- has yet experienced. I also believe that there are certain groups (such as oil and gas extraction corporations) that are actively undermining the severity of climate change for purely egocentric reasons. By concealing the true dangers of our situation, they are slowing our reaction time, buying them more time to make money. 
 <br><br>
I felt very deeply touched by Ken’s apology, as I do not think I have ever experienced someone apologizing for their whole generation’s mistakes, especially when it is not directly their fault. This issue has been brewing for decades upon decades, and although it is too late to reverse the damage that climate change has already caused, we CAN still save this earth from becoming entirely extinct. 
 <br><br>
I also would like to acknowledge Ken’s explanation of the time delay; I feel as though many individuals do not fully grasp the fact that even if we could halt CO2 emissions entirely, even if we could stop the ever-growing feedback loop, there is still decades of damage that will manifest from our past decisions. For example, the amount of carbon currently in our atmosphere is around 415ppm. By 2100, this amount could reach up to 1000ppm, which would decrease human cognitive ability by 21%. In this moment, we are literally creating a negative impact on the future mental coherence of future generations; of our kids, grandchildren, great-grandchildren. And this is just one of the many detrimental effects caused by human selfishness.
 <br><br>
If the pure multitude of evidence on the destructive effects of climate change are not enough to open our eyes and push us to make a change, I truly believe that we do not deserve this planet in the first place. But, as of now, my view on this issue is still sanguine. I believe we CAN make a constructive change, if we all work in conjunction.

I would also like to acknowledge Ken's apology on behalf of the entire previous generation of adults for their complicit role in the propagation of this crisis. I think this statement is bold, and it really cements the idea that most of the damage our Earth is now facing has been caused within the span of a single lifetime. However, I would also like to offer up some sense of forgiveness to Ken and his generation. Truthfully, Ken is not responsible for the severity of this crisis. In fact, the actors with the most responsibility for causing this situation are often those that make the least acknowledgment or do the least to stop it. Western countries are disproportionately responsible for greenhouse gas emissions that are polluting our atmosphere and causing global warming. The amount of consumption that our society lives off of is very striking. Even within developed countries such as the United States, though, the average citizen is not the one responsible for the crisis we are facing. The people with the most power are also those with the most guilt. A small minority of those with the most wealth and power have a great degree of control over what policy actually gets implemented, and unfortunately, these people often have little desire to protect our Earth. 
<br><br>
Because of this massive inequality in our global ability to affect climate change, I believe that one of the only real actionable solutions would be to roust those in power and introduce leaders with a positive and progressive vision about how to heal our planet. Climate change should not be a political issue. Any human being who lives on Earth should want to fight this impending disaster because sooner or later, it will affect all of us.

I found that both of these lectures were educational and accurately describe the state of the world that the younger generations like myself are going to have to live with. I think that these lectures were very useful in conceptualizing the time line of the climate crisis. I think that it also properly shows how  so few people can have significant impact on the climate, in such short time. I think that knowing the people who created this crisis are still doing so out of habit is annoying and makes me angry. Even still, I have long been aware of the statistics regarding the industrial world, it's small population, and huge carbon footprint, so relearning that, while still difficult to imagine, was not as shocking as it once was.
</p><hr>



<p>
There is intergenerational injustice in the climate crisis, however, Ken’s analogy of how one in eight people smoked under the impression of impunity revealed to me an aspect I had overlooked: they did not know there would be consequences. I felt sorry for them. It is not their fault carbon dioxide has a delayed effect on the climate, but now that things have gotten so bad, they must feel so guilty; their innocent children are suffering. Putting that much CO2 into the atmosphere without knowing the consequences is forgivable. Still being in denial and continuing their actions after learning of the consequences, however, is unacceptable. I remember a documentary I watched where a girl in China could not play outside because the air is too polluted. She did nothing to cause that problem, yet her freedom to play and go outside is taken away. I believe one possible cause of the previous generations carrying on as usual and ignoring the problem is that they cannot accept the fact that THEY caused this and that they are at fault. The guilt must be so overbearing that they cannot accept the truth or take responsibility. 
<br><br>
But I am still angry. Not just for the future generations but for the present generation, the majority, such the poorest 3 billion who contributed to only 5% of CO2 in the atmosphere. It is extremely inconsiderate of us to pollute the planet, which we SHARE, and inflict natural disasters and disease onto others. It is like having a terrible roommate, only much worse. It is like gassing the room, wearing a gas mask, and making your roommate breathe the toxic fumes. This room is as much theirs as it is yours. Why should they suffer the consequences of your actions more than you do? Developed countries should be ashamed of themselves, step up, and take responsibility. America, 4% of the population, emits 25% of greenhouse gases. If just 4% of the global population changed their lifestyle, GHG emissions would significantly decrease. If the majority of the world can contribute to only 5%, maybe if we adopted their lifestyles, we would solve this problem. Moreover, if they can live like that, why can’t we make some sacrifices? What makes us so much better than them that we can live lavishly while inflicting harm on others? People are dying of kidney disease due to the extreme heat in El Salvador, according to Wallace Wells. We are tossing food away because it is deformed, causing it to release methane into the atmosphere. We cling to our culture of excessive consumption of beef, obsession of cars, and equating consumption to social status. I think part of it is that they don’t believe the alternatives are better. Just “helping the environment” is not good enough an incentive. We must show how it benefits them. 
<br><br>
I think the most surprising thing I learned is that ¾ of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere by humans was put there in a single lifetime. I wonder why. What happened in 1969 and forth?

<p>
We are living in a climate crisis and suffering the consequences from the actions of another generation. It is sad to know that these people knew what they were doing, and they knew the potential consequences, yet they left it for us, the younger generation to suffer as well. I think that is is good that the younger generation is doing something. But I also think, we would not have had to do something about it if the generation responsible for it, were responsible and careful with their actions. Yes the burden was put on us, but there is no more time to point fingers or blame others. I think it is important to just be in the now and do what is best for the crisis now. The younger generation is doing something about it because we are left to grow up in this crisis. In Ken’s lecture I was baffled and sad to hear the statistics about CO2. Developed countries which make up ⅛ of the Earth’s population, is responsible for almost ⅔ of the CO2. The poorest people on this planet which make up 3 billion, are responsible for only 5% of CO2. Lastly, Ken’s apology for his generation showed me that there are some from his generation that still care and are deeply ashamed for what they didn’t do at their time. I think it's important to acknowledge the youth who are taking action, but also the ones from the previous generation who are trying to suport us as they know that they have already let us down during their time.

<p>
In the "climate crisis as a generational issue" lecture, Ken has explained how one generation's actions have, whether intentional or not, left their younger successors a worse environment to live. In the "climate crisis brought about in a single lifetime" lecture, Ken uses powerful words to highlight the drastic impact of human-caused climate change in the past 50-60 years. While I do find the narration sincere and heart-warming, I don't think that every individual of Ken's generation needs to necessarily take the blame for being the largest polluters of this planet. Our awareness of the world is constantly evolving and improving; 80 years ago, we were still suffering from lower qualities of life and less stable societies, yet we have in general improved our living standards through mass industrialization, technological innovation and the Internet boom. (This does not mean that today's world no longer has war, poverty and other serious issues that need to be addressed, but generally speaking, although we've increased our emissions in the past few decades, today's generation is mostly better off.)
<br><br>
What we need now is not to draw lines along the generational divide and point fingers at each other for sharing the largest blames; rather, we need to take collective responsibility and recognize climate change mitigation as a common challenge for every human being. Yes, we could have realized the environmental consequences of our actions a little earlier, but now is not too late! In fact, here's something everyone can do, in the words of Sir David Attenborough: Don't live a wasteful lifestyle. Don't waste food. Don't waste water. Don't buy things you don't need to consume...This is a fundamental principle that should hopefully reach across all generations, and if we can achieve this step alone, we'll have already contributed a great solution to the problem.
</p><hr>



<p>
In the lectures, "The climate crisis is a generational issue" and "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime", Ken emphasizes how this climate crisis has truly been exacerbated in a single generation. Considering that 3/4 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been put there from the mid-twentieth century to now and it has raised the level of carbon dioxide to around 415 parts per million.1/4 of the carbon dioxide that is found in the atmosphere has been put there by the United States. When we take into consideration how small the population of the United States is to the rest of the world, we are creating a situation that will impact countries that have put far less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than us first. 
<br><br>
It is not only a responsibility of older generations to acknowledge that the climate crisis is real and is impacting everyone around the world, but also to take a much larger initiative in reducing their carbon footprint. Younger generations who have much more at stake have been more vocal about the steps that need to be taken to reduce the impacts of the climate crisis. However, that does not mean that every young person is equally putting in the effort to reduce their carbon footprint.

As you stated, not every person in the current generation does what they can to help the climate change issue. Our generation has shown anger and resistance, which is an accomplishment yet we need more action. Ken acknowledging in his video that the current generation is resisting to the climate crisis is something I appreciated listening to. Like you said, younger generations will suffer far more greatly for what older generations have created and leave us with. It is definitely upsetting to hear that older generations are responsible for 3/4 of CO2 in the atmosphere however I believe that it's all of humankind's responsibility to do what they can to help the climate crisis from only advancing.  
<br><br>
It is so infuriating to know and witness the fact that the US is one of the main nations at fault for the amount of CO2 emitted. As it is no surprise, it is not something other nations and poor folks should suffer the consequences from yet do because of money driven nations that don't advocate for the wellbeing of people. As you stated, these nations and people who will suffer the consequences will be greatly impacted over things they did not cause. People all over the world and in the US are suffering due to climate change that is greatly denied by many politicians in order to continue to gain millions leaving people and our planet to die.

Coming into this world it may seem as if the harm has been done and there is nothing left to do about it since most of it was caused probably when we were babies or when we were not even born yet; however, the climate crisis is still happening and we are still contributing to the cause of it. We might not be in control of what other people do, but we surely are in control of our actions and how we influence others and our planet. Only our country, along with Europe and Russia are responsible for about two-thirds of the CO2 emissions produced around the globe, while 3 billion people within the poorest communities have only produced about 5% of CO2 emissions. Yet those underdeveloped countries are the most affected while the developed countries keep consuming and harming our planet, they get the highest temperatures and as we saw in the film “Before the Flood”, all those communities that are surrounded by industries are choked with pollution. 
<br><br>
It is crazy how Professor Hiltner is apologizing, while the main contributors of this crisis can’t even take the blame, left alone use their resources and money to invest in renewable alternatives for burning fossil fuels. Instead, they turn their backs and ignore the problem and keep doing what they have been doing for decades.
</p><hr>



<p>
The climate crisis was brought together in a single generation and I think that is absurd. The professor used a smoking analogy and that really helps model how the problem has unfolded. In the past 60 years, roughly a lifetime, ¾ of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was put there. We knew of the repercussions, but we didn’t take them too seriously and now we’re left to deal with it. A lot of times it’s easy to get lost in the moment and forget about what’s to come. I just think that now is our time to act. The youth and people in America have to realize the severity of the problem and speak out about it in order for our government officials to start taking action. It makes me sad to think that my children will live not only live in a world ravaged by famine, drought, natural disaster and that has to be the motivation for the future. What will our lives be in 20 years if we don’t take climate change seriously like the generations that have come before us? Scare resources cause conflict and I hope we can make the change necessary.
</p><hr>



<p>
The problems with global climate change as well as the climate crisis have plagued people for a long time. However, when some people rack their brains to think of methods that can improve the environment without many actions taking, others are still polluted the Earth for the reason that they only seen a few bad influences brought by their actions. This kind of opinion is not true. The reason why people didn’t see any of that is because “there will be a significant time delay before the consequences are felt.” (lecture2, How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime) People will leave the Earth to their children in a state of devastation because of their actions of polluting the Earth. Just like what the first lecture said, our children will suffer the terrible climate and environment since they are born because of their parents’ actions.
<br><br>
To be honest, before seeing “The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about a single lifetime” these two lectures, I didn’t realize that the negative effects which human brought to the environment can be so awful and long-lasting. They can even influence the body conditions and lives of several generations after us. These two lectures call for people’s actions to save the Earth and the environment.
</p><hr>



<p>
The climate crisis as a generational issue and how the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime are two issues that transport from last generation to our current situation，and in the future，the next generation need to take them.  First of all，we need to realize that human are always conteibuting to the climate crisis. We usually think that our small actions will not have any effect on the climate，for instance，when one factory consider that releasing some carbon dioxide during the production process will not rise the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This thought is completely wrong and weird，because not only this factory will use this logic and do the same thing. What we actually should do to control the speed of climate crisis is that we need to eliminate any thoughts related to self-interest.  As compared with protecting our environment（actually this is prevention of more species in the world）， interest is not important，even useless. Secondly， I strongly agree with opinion of climate justice. Many developed countries，like America，China，release more greenhouse gases than developing countries. However，developed countries are always paying more money to deal with those climate problems，but developing countries have no money to impose some necessary actions. Consequently，people in developing country need to suffer more. From previous readings and films，I know how serious the climate crisis will influence human health. This phenomenon is not fair enough for poor people. This will more people sick and their life quality will decrease dramatically. From my perspective， I think that people in whole world need to against this problem together to keep or slow the rate of climate change and pay more attention to keep economics，health stable.

The generational split on climate change is tragic. It is unfortunate that the younger generations have to suffer and fix the mistakes of the generations before them. It is so crazy to think about how the climate crisis is a generational problem.  Ken’s analogy of the trend of smokers slowly affecting everyone around them. I wish that people, myself included, can be more aware of how my actions affects the environment even if I can not directly see it. I feel terrible for the countries that are not contributing to global warming are suffering the consequences of the developing countries' actions. It is very shocking to hear how much carbon dioxide has been released into the air in the last century alone.
<br><br>
 I was very surprised to hear Ken’s apology in the end of the second video. This makes me feel more encouraged to be an activist for the environment, since it is just not my generation that is fighting for the future of the planet. Although Ken’s generation may have done the bulk of the pollution(75% of the CO2 emitted in the environment being from the span of his lifetime), it is not fair to place the blame on them. This current generation if anything is creating more or less the same amount of carbon footprint. No one should be playing the blame game and just work together to fix the environment. I am positive that if we were in their generation we would have easily made the same mistakes. This generation must continue to advocate for environmental change and be the change.
</p><hr>



<p>
In his lecture “The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue,” Ken introduces the idea that environmental activism now is a response to the initial issues that were not acted upon before. I thoroughly enjoyed Ken’s lecture on the beginnings of the climate crisis as a result of a difference in the appearance of environmental degradation over time. I think that Ken’s analogy of smoking a cigarette now without consequence while delaying and passing on its effects to one’s children is a perspective on intergenerational anthropogenic climate change that I had never considered before. The statistics that Ken points out is undoubtedly shocking, considering the fact that the climate crisis accelerated very rapidly in such a short amount of time. I was specifically struck by the part where he explains how the presence of CO2 in the atmosphere tripled in the past 60 years compared to its rise in the past.
<br><br>
I absolutely loved the sincere apology Ken puts forth at the end of his lecture. These words are often not stated enough by all of us who, in one way or another, have been exposed to or played a role in today’s problems. It is consequently interesting to see how some of the same values and practices have been adopted by our generation. Such an action alone, I believe, can encourage and motivate our generation to divert towards protecting the environment from any more degradation than it has already been exposed to.

In this video ken makes one main point that the generation before us has largely impacted climate change. Hearing that makes the listerer realize how important it is for our generation to change while we can. The fact that everything can get so much worse if we dont change soon and then the fact that the next generation would haveto suffer the consequenses seems horrific. I completely agree with what you said about how Ken apologizing is very nice. I also think Ken using analogies and speaking us as if encouraging us was wonderful.

The videos, “The climate crisis is a general issue,” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” both discuss how previous generations have set the stage for the current and upcoming problems our world will face in terms of the climate crisis. In “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” video, helped me get a good understanding of the climate crisis and how it has been progressively affecting our planet for hundreds of years. It is mentioned at the beginning of the video that the major role in bringing the climate crisis was the fact that there is a significant time delay before anything is felt. This statement I believe is extremely accurate and does explain why the climate crisis is an ongoing problem because maybe if there were instant effects, it would urge our world to act on creating a solution for this crisis, instead of ignoring the crisis since the effects are not immediately felt and rather slowly and gradually taking place, and why it constantly goes unnoticeable. Also, if the effects were quickly noticeable I believe that perhaps the previous generations would have felt the need to teach their children about the crisis and raise them differently, showing them how to live sustainable lives. Relating this to the idea of being able to smoke cigarettes without any personal effects, but lasting effects on millions of people and future generations around us, also really helped me understand the fact that human activity is significantly increasing climate change and is taking place currently and has been for the past hundreds of years. Fossil fuel addition has been taking place and is only growing. Dozens of generations are going to be impacted by what previous generations and us humans, in general, have done. 
<br><br>
I was also intrigued by learning more about carbon dioxide, the most significant greenhouse gas. I was shocked by the fact that in the past 60 years the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by 100 points, which is three times more than it rose in the proceeding centuries. The fact that these numbers keep rising starts to worry me and open my eyes to the reality that if solutions and changes do not take place it may be too late to save our world as a whole.

I feel like I had a very similar take away to these videos as you. One of the ideas in this video that I found the most interesting was what you have mentioned about there being such a long delay between our actions and the consequences of our actions. I agree with you and Hiltner that if these consequences had been visible sooner, then it is highly unlikely that climate change would have gotten to this point. If we were able to see the effects of our actions right away, everyone would be aware of how much harm we are doing and we would not be able to ignore it. I also agree that the cigarette metaphor used by Hiltner did a great job of explaining the effects of climate change on future generations and urging people to be more conscious of their actions. I know that for me at least, I am much more driven to action knowing that I could potentially be harming future generations, rather than believing I am only affecting my own life. I think that it is very important to keep future generations in mind whenever we are thinking about the climate crisis, so that we can be motivated to make a change, instead of giving up hope.
<br><br><hr><br>

I agree with your comment. While many companies and scientists have been acutely aware of the problem that climate change poses, it can be difficult for the general public to get a handle on. Many scientists have been actively trying to warn us for decades, but the fact that many companies that heavily rely on fossil fuels does not help. These companies try to deliberately confuse the public and actively lobby against climate change laws. This certainly does not help especially when taking into consideration, as you and the video pointed out, the delayed effects of climate change. When the general public finally does realize how much we are being misled and collectively decides to slam the brake on climate change I fear it may be too late and that we may crash no matter what. The fact that there is a tipping point that we steadily approaching is what concerns me the most. It invokes a big fear of a barren Earth hostile to all life.

A point from these lectures that really struck me is that out of the 3 million years that humans have been on this Earth, climate change has only developed in the past lifetime, at the hands of the generation before my own. Although they caused this issue, and are continuing to make it worse, we cannot focus on blaming one specific generation for this issue. We need to focus on making everyone aware of this crisis and educating the next generation on how to stop it. We consider ourselves the most intelligent species on the planet, yet we are destroying our own home, as well as every other species home, faster than we can save it. Another astonishing piece of evidence from these lectures is that the U.S, making up only 4% of the world’s population, has contributed to 25% of the world's CO2 admissions, while the 3 billion poorest members of the population have only contributed to 5%. How can we say that other countries should reduce their admissions when we are the biggest culprit? The hypocrisy of this is disgusting. I think if more Americans were aware of this statistic, they might think twice about blaming others for the climate crisis. I think our first step should be to reduce the U.S emissions, then we can move on to helping other countries with theirs. The best start for this would be to elect people who actually believe in climate change and want to do something about it. We aren’t going to get anywhere if the people in power don’t even believe the climate crisis is a real issue. I’ve heard many people in the generation above me say that the climate crisis is just the issue of our generation, just like the Cold War was for theirs. To me, the climate crisis should concern everybody and is not just another bump in the road. It is going to take effort from everybody and multiple generations to solve.

I agree with what you stated in this video.  It is true, it is our fault that this might happen and at this rate will happen.  It is very depressing how the generations to come will suffer for our mistakes, that we have made.  I found it very intriguing and at the same time sad how the climate crisis, was caused in a single life time.  What is ironic about this is, since it was caused in a single life time, the people who created it are still making it worse.  And it seems like they have no intention of making it better in any way.  It seems as if they only want to make it worse.  If the climate crisis happens which is almost inevitable at the alarming rate CO2 and greenhouse gases are being released, then there will be a significant time delay before the consequences are actually felt.  This is very sad because this means that most likely the people who have created this problem are not going to feel the consequences.  The reason for the climate crisis to not be worse is because the ocean absorbs a lot of the CO2 released, which in a way is good because it is keeping the climate crisis from happening sooner.  However, because the ocean is absorbing the CO2, it is making the ocean very acidic, making it very difficult for many species who reside in the ocean be able to live.  Actually because the ocean is becoming acidic, many species are dying.  Not only do oceanic species suffer from this but other species will suffer from the climate crisis as well.  If the climate crisis happens thousands of species will suffer and many would go completely extinct.  Although, the facts are right there and are being put into the people who have created this issues' face, they are ignorant and do not see what will happen and what is happening to our home.

Professor Hiltner’s lecture in this video “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” greatly emphasized the build-up of our current climate crisis.  I thought the analogy with smoking without any consequences yet still having an effect on the future generation to the climate crisis was a great way to put things into perspective and is the thing that caught my attention. A person could smoke without any negative impact on their health and would be empowered to smoke 3, 4, or 5 packs every day for their entire life, but the catch would be their children would suffer from those actions -- cancer, heart disease, stroke, and plenty more health problems. And if enough people did, then most of the population would be suffering from these diseases. And if this range of people were affected, then all life of the planet would be too from the sky to the ocean. This whole segment underscored how climate crisis is a generational issue and has a domino-like structure. Because of how the last generations acted, our earth is under its current condition.
<br><br>
As the smoking analogy suggests, not everyone on the earth has to smoke for people to suffer. If enough do, then despite the efforts of those who don’t smoke are overshadowed. We are not excused. Despite the United States being four times smaller in population than Africa, we remain responsible for a quarter of the world’s contribution of CO2 released in the atmosphere. With our wealth and advancement, we still ignorantly use up more CO2 and though the impoverished may contribute less due to their circumstances, they are still doing a better job than our country’s leaders and even us citizens of taking care of our planet with their 5% contribution. Countries such as the United States, Russia, and China are too educated and much more developed to abstain from doing nothing. Choosing to continue our ways ultimately means choosing to continue to lead our planet to doom. Though the previous generation, by their choices in life, have failed to teach us how to live sustainably and as a result, allowed us to follow the same habit of abusing our home, it doesn’t mean we have to. We can choose not to smoke, regardless of immediate effect… We can choose not to worsen the conditions of our planet by minimizing our carbon footprint and not continuing the same actions as previous lifetimes have. Professor Hiltner displayed my generation protesting in Santa Barbara and I interpret that as a calling for someone like me, nowhere near rich or in power, to demand change from those who may hold the cards. Knowing those with most power correspond with those most distant from the hardships that come with climate change, with those who share the same stance and status as me, the Lilliputian strategy just may be enough to be heard and have serious steps invested in and enforced.

No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible. Indeed, it is human nature to postpone thinking of consequences that’s not at stake and aim toward the immediate rewards. However the avalanche will eventually get to us, so therefore instead of arguing for who caused that disaster we should focus on how to remedy the issue.
<br><br>
I used to feel satisfied with what I did for the environment. I switched into more energy efficient light bulbs, reused plastic bags, and I use públic transportation as much as I can. However, I have to admit that more can be done. I consumed more clothings and cosmetic products than I’ll be using. By the same time, I pay attention to mostly the price of the products I bought without further pondering over what sacrifices the factory workers and the environment might have made in order for me to buy it at such a low price.

<p>
Of all the disturbing truths of Climate Change, I find the most powerful one to be the discrepancy between the people causing Climate Change, and those who will be most affected by it. 1/4 of the CO2 in our atmosphere was put in by the United States. 2/3 is from Europe, the US, and Russia combined; each of these containing highly developed countries. These developed nations are the ones pumping the most Greenhouse gases into the air, as many of their economies are built upon the fossil fuel industry. In fact, most of the developed places in the world are as developed as they are due to building their economy upon fossil fuels. However, the places that will be most affected are undeveloped countries. The poorest 3 billion people (almost 50% of the worlds population) only contribute 5% of Greenhouse gases to atmosphere, yet they are the same people who will be most impacted. We have already seen this, in raging natural disasters, such as hurricane Dorian, the most impactful hurricane to hit the world. Those impacted the most? Natives of the Bahamas. A person of the U.S. has a carbon footprint most like 10 times that of a Bahama native, if not more. 
<br><br>
It's no wonder so many in the U.S. don't believe in or care about climate change. They have the resources and money to survive the first hit. And this, is what disgusts me. There will be a 2nd hit, if no changes are made, and this time, everyone will be affected. Why not take action now? Why not help those who are already being affected? It goes to show the mindset of many people in the U.S., and how they simply care for themselves and no one else. For them, the planet is not an issue. The animals and other species dying are not an issue. Our fellow humans dying are not even on their radar. No, climate change will only become an issue to them, when they themselves are in danger. And that, is the core of this issue. 
<br><br>
People in developed countries need to see that although climate change may not be directly affecting them yet (though we know in small amounts it is) natural disasters will soon be at their doorsteps. They need to learn to care about their planet, and the generations coming next. The world does not revolve around one person. Action needs to be taken to help not only those who are being affected now, but to prevent it from affecting people all over the world.

<p>
This video demonstrates to me the root cause of all issues surrounding climate change: money and self interest. I think the cigarette comparison was a solid way of demonstrating how one’s impacts, even if at the time they think there are no consequences, can damage generations following them. And the ultimate question is: do those people care that the future generations are going to feel the effects or do they not care because they don’t have to deal with the consequences themselves? While I think there are still a large amount of people who do care about the impacts their decisions have had, the ones with the power and the money do not. The fossil fuel industry and politicians have the power to prevent what is currently happening, yet they do not care because they do not feel the consequences of their impacts. One of the saddest parts to me was that almost half the population, mostly poor or lacking as much power, were the ones who have contributed only 5% of Co2 emissions. Nations that are largely focused on consumerism need to take a step back and realize the effects of backing up the companies and decisions that are destroying this planet. 
<br><br>
The climate crisis as a generational issue video shows how since our generation is starting to feel the effects and know we will even more in the near future, we have more of an incentive to act. It is unfair that our generation is stuck in such a position due to the decisions of people preceding us. As young people, it is now our job and responsibility to change these actions. I have hope that when this generation is in political and economic power, they will be more motivated to make sustainable decisions and to have more empathy for the environment and future generations, instead of being money hungry. As the impacts of climate change continue to exponentially increase, there will be even more outrage from younger generations who are worried about their own futures, and rightfully so.

<p>
It is selfish to be polluting the earth so much only for future generations to be affected the most by actions taking in today’s world where they do not have a voice yet. Carbon dioxide does not only affect the way ecosystems normally function but also causes health complications for many. It can cause respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and more health issues which are not always taken into consideration now. We can see how a change in climate has already caused many around the world kidney disease, asthma, skin conditions, and so much more. It is concerning that the conditions we see today are not the furthest extent of effects of climate change, knowing it will continue to get worse if no action is taken to hold companies and industries responsible. With so much evidence to support climate scientists on their standpoint for a rapidly changing climate, it is ridiculous that many industries continue to discredit them in order to continue business at the cost of future generations suffering the consequences.

<p>
As “the the climate crisis as a generation issue” suggests, humans are clearly aware of the problem we faced but always failed to act.
<br><br>
People always say that they need to act not for themselves but also for their children and for next generations, however, ironically, the past generations haven’t really did any actions to stop what’s bring up the climate crisis. In the lecture “how the climate crisis was brought about in a single life form,” there’s a model to demonstrate how huge amount of CO2 releasing to the atmosphere will finally change the whole planet by decades, even though in a short term there won’t be obvious impact. The delay of the impact is what make current generation feel less alarmed about the climate crisis, which is the reason why they pay less attention on what they did to earth. The parallel of cigarettes example is really vivid. Parents are people who smoke but their children are the ones suffer much more. Similarly, while current generations are causing more carbon dioxide releasing to the atmosphere, their children would be the one suffer from the consequences. According to the video, the CO2 in the atmosphere has rose from 280ppm to 315ppm in 1945 as the result of Digging of fossil fuels. And now in 2019, the CO2 in the atmosphere is even higher as 415ppm than the past. The change is so huge and fast that this generation must be responsible and take actions and also now the next generation coming to the stage who should help as well.

<p>
I definitely agree that this is the issue of our generation. We can see with Ken’s statistics that CO2 amounts are rising and have been rising for 400 years, but now at a higher rate than ever. With the previous generation’s lack of trust in science, our generation is suffering with the consequences. We see politicians who simply do not believe in this issue or care because they will be dead by the time we will see the truly disastrous effects. Even now I personally see effects of climate change everyday, with the stars being almost unseeable in the sky of Los Angeles to the fires in Santa Barbara. We are seeing the effects now and the news is calling it “weather”. I do, however, believe that we are seeing changes, with climate activist Greta Thunberg being named Time’s “Person of the Year” and Oxford dictionary’s word of the year being “climate emergency.” This is not only a generational issue, a decade issue, or a yearly issue, this is a now issue. 
<br><br>
Not only are we seeing effects here in the United States, but poorer countries are suffering because of our actions. As Ken had said, the poorest 36% of people in the world only make up 5% of the co2 emissions. We can see how this is becoming an issue of racism as well as privilege in not only Ken’s lectures but in his videos. The sad part is that if we don’t do anything then not only will we suffer, but the generations after us will suffer, rich and poor. As a country who is one of the leading countries that generate the most CO2 into the atmosphere, we have to make a change and think about our actions and who we elect in office.
</p><hr>



<p>
The lectures serve the purpose of showing how grave the climate situation has become in just a short span of 60 years. Carbon dioxide emissions increasing by 100 points in that span of years is definitely alarming and is meant to confirm that climate change is a reality of our lifetime and will continue to get worse if solutions aren’t found as soon as possible. It is astonishing how the wealthier have contributed way more to this issue than any others. It is also of great concern how much our own country is responsible for this situation, even though our nation makes up only 4% of the world population. Our generations, past and present have all contributed to this generational phenomena and it is our duty too as human beings to try and fix it for the sake of mankind. Everything is passed down through generations; the good and the bad and it is necessary to fix the bad, in this case climate change, to build a better future. It isn’t the time to lament or look past this issue as there is still plenty of time to solve it and improve the conditions we’re living in.

I was shocked by the fact that most severe harm to the earth is created by just one generation and the most of these people are still alive, making the situation even worse. What they have done on the earth will not just influence themselves, but also the future thousands of generations of all lives. Ken also mentions how PPM increased significantly from 1959 to 2019, from 315 to 415 PPM,  and it is just caused by a single lifetime. In addition, the US is responsible for a quarter of the CO2, with just a little percentage of the whole population, but it affects all the lives around world in negative aspect. After watching this video, I realized how we can do just little things that really will make a difference in both positive and negative ways.

<p>
In “The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue” professor Hiltner makes it clear that the generations before him and his generation did not do enough to prevent the climate crisis for my generation. His generation’s lack of action has fueled the new emerging generation of adults with anger and has caused them to take action in massive numbers. This gives me hope for our future knowing that so many young people are taking action despite fighting a completely uphill battle. However, it still blows my mind how the people who caused this crisis still are not doing enough to help defuse the crisis. 
<br><br>
In “How the Climate Crisis was Brought in a Single Lifetime”, it was terrifying to learn that one quart of oil dumped down a storm drain can contaminate 1 million gallons of water. Hiltner mentioned that the time delay in the effects of climate change caused many people to continue their old ways of life. Especially the older generations who see no need to change the way they live on our planet. Hiltner made the perfect analogy with cigarettes and how your grandkids and their offspring will be affected from the day they are born. It was extremely hard to learn that billions of people will suffer because of the actions of a tiny percentage of the world’s population. Not only will humans suffer, but all other forms of life on Earth will die off. Every living thing on Earth is going to be suffering because of the generations before them and forced to live on a planet that is slowly turning into a wasteland. It bothered me that developed countries will not suffer nearly as much as poorer countries will in the foreseeable future. Despite not contributing nearly anything to the climate crisis, the poor will pay the price. I still find it crazy that politicians can still support these big fossil fuel companies despite having endless evidence that the earth is endangered. Also, Hiltner brings up the interesting point that his generation didn’t teach the new ones how to live sustainably. This is because many of the older generations did not realize the global issues they were causing. I am very optimistic that we are not out of time to act as long as everyone does their own part, and develops an environmental consciousness before their environment becomes endangered.

<p>
In "The Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue" and "How the Climate Crisis Was Brought About in a Single Lifetime", the biggest point made is that this whole issue of climate change was and is caused by a generation who lacks any foresight of the problems that their actions will inflict on both the planet and the newest generation. Although it is an extremely unfortunate situation that my generation now has to try its best to reverse the mistakes that the past generation has made in hurting our planet, to be completely honest, I can't be mad at them. For a vast majority of them, they are normal everyday citizens who were never educated about the harmful effects of that their lifestyle could produce. It was only until the last two decades or so that people started to realize that their wasteful habits of pollution and over reliance on fossil fuels have been hurting the planet and so now we see (at least most of) the people of that generation taking action to help the Earth. I find it hard to believe that the past generation continued this lifestyle because they purposefully want to harm the planet and make their children's lives miserable. Since we can't go back in time to change these actions, we must all come together united in our will to make Earth a better place for the present and future people and animals that inhabit it.

This video rightly states that the major reason as to why the planet is in its current condition is that there is a delay between the time the pollution starts and the time the effects of the pollution become clear.  The industrial revolution was and still is viewed as a wonderful thing because it allowed for the creation of the modern world.  However, the industrial revolution is also the reason behind why the planet is as polluted as it is today.  The industrial revolution marks a significant time in human history, making it one of the golden spikes of the Anthropocene, because it marks a significant change in the way humans are affecting the world.  
<br><br>
For a short period of time, the time were factories were being developed and the only concern was ways to make factories more efficient, humans enjoyed an increase in their quality of life.  It was not until much later that any consequence of the industrial revolution became obvious, the most severe of these early consequences being the Great Smog of London of 1952, which killed thousands of people.  But, at this point, what was to be done?  Obviously people can not just get rid of the factories because they had become dependent on them.  Efforts can be made to reduce emissions, but this is still adding to the problem, just at a slower rate.  Thus, humanity has created a problem that will lead the planet to its destruction should nothing be done about it.
<br><br>
I believe that it is very possible to fix what humanity has done to the planet.  The current generation of people is more willing to confront climate change, which means more effort will be taken to reducing and reversing the damage caused by climate change.  As someone whose future will definitely be affected by climate change, I, and many others like me, are more likely to focus on the issue of climate change, which means that the world will be progressing towards a future where reversal of climate change is on everyone’s agenda.

It is interesting to compare this video to online discourse about generational politics. "OK Boomer" is a now-dead meme, but it embodied a very specific and widespread feeling that many young people share: that older people, especially baby boomers, have destroyed the world and our lives and deserve to be ignored. There is such absolute generational hate, and this video sees it as justified: our professor has genuinely apologized, to our faces, about what people his age have done. How they have wrecked the planet in a decade.
<br><br>
But is this really about one generation?
<br><br>
One motif I see semi-commonly brought up during chants of "OK Boomer" is that generational politics are a scapegoat, and that the real problem always lies in material conditions. The processes that led to the baby boomers generating massive CO2 emissions have been churning for decades beforehand: really, it all started with the industrial revolution. Is it fair to simply blame old people, and leave it at that, when human civilization has been coming to this conclusion of catastrophe for so long? Factories have been becoming more efficient, energy is becoming more necessary, we consume more and produce more and desire more and ship more, and all of these things require more fossil fuels and more growth. All of this does not lie with boomers, but in the systems we take part in. A fetishization of infinite-growth economies, massive consumerism, capitalism as a whole; how can we say it's simply old people's fault when they've been primed for this since long before they were born? Can we really pretend that our generation would have been any different had we been born at the same time they were? Is it really that surprising that people didn't believe in climate change when it had not yet physically manifested and they had every material incentive to pretend it didn't exist?
<br><br>
This is not to say baby boomers are blameless. They are not. But I often see people reducing the problem and simply hating their grandparents, blaming it on nothing more than the moral of their collective character. There are reasons they were this way, reasons that we have to address. We have to change the material conditions of our society if we want to end up any differently than they did.

The lecture "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" shocked me. The lecture highlighted how carbon dioxide emissions have increased hundreds of times since 1959. But what impressed me most about the lecture was the carbon emissions ratio of developed and developing countries. Developed countries, including the United States, Europe, and Russia, account for two-thirds of the world's carbon emissions. The poorest places, such as some countries in Africa, emit only 5% of global carbon dioxide. How unfair this is, but how logical it is to remember it. Only developed countries can afford to emit more carbon dioxide, while poor countries can only silently bear the serious consequences of excessive carbon emissions. But I don't think this is the fault of a generation, but the necessary process of the development of the whole world. In the era of industrialization, humans can only develop their own civilization by emitting a large amount of carbon dioxide until humans find an element that can replace carbon, otherwise human civilization will stagnate. And now that human beings are likely to develop clean energy that replaces carbon, when we look back at the development of our civilization, we are not qualified to criticize or condemn anything the previous generation has done for development.

I was also shocked to learn that two-thirds of the world's CO2 emissions were done by the "developed" nations. I find it cruel that these nations that are incredibly wealthy are blindly running their businesses regardless of the impact it has on the earth. The poorest nations will have less resources and knowledge on how to battle the effects of climate change and inevitably will be the ones to suffer first. I don't agree with your statement that the fault of the rise in CO2 is a necessary process due to the development of the world. Just because the by-product of our industries are large quantities of CO2, doesn't mean that limitations can't be placed on these corporations. Clean energy could be achieved if it wasn't so expensive and the industry leaders weren't so obsessed with making their yearly profits. We should be able to criticize the previous generations because they made the mistake of unleashing CO2 into the atmosphere blindly, without even considering the impacts it could have on future generations.

In Ken’s lecture video on how quickly the climate crisis came about, he talks about how a small portion of the world’s population (i.e. the people of America) caused a much larger amount of pollution than many other countries of the world. I feel that this point is particularly frustrating because it illustrates several instances of environment injustice, such as the one from the post-WW2 generation unto the current generation, and the one from the developed world to the undeveloped world. In particular, the lack of foresight and empathy by the people that had the ability to stop the climate crisis before it could fully emerge is frustrating because our current generation is mostly aware of and attempting to deal with it, yet it is the generation that caused it that constantly undermines and denies the threat at hand. I personally feel a sense of indignity over it, as I’m the one who has to deal with this future. However, I also hold the responsibility of helping deal with the crisis so that the people of the world are better off than I am. It would be foolish for the people of today to not act because they are the ones who will live to see the full effects of climate change. However, so many people remain ignorant about the problem at hand that it leaves a rather worrisome sign about our future. Hopefully through our own education, we can spread our knowledge to more people in hopes of a better future.

Apology accepted XD. Just kidding. In fact, there is no need to apologize. Admittedly, the environment is getting worse and worse as Hiltner told us in the video. However, environmental pollution is an inevitable result of social progress. In ancient times, we couldn't enjoy the convenience of shopping without leaving home, we couldn't arrive in another country in a day, and we couldn't have the advanced medical technology to save our life. There is no doubt that "gain and loss" can be used to explain all the negative “loss”, which is the pollution. Therefore, since we all have the right to enjoy the “gain,” complaining about the “loss” seems a little bit immature, let alone let others apologize.
<br><br>
True, it is quite unfair for some poor countries, which only contribute 5 percent of the CO2 while suffering the detrimental effects of polluted air. They are innocent. Or in other words, like the "gain and loss," they shouldn't deserve so much "loss." Thus, the most important thing here is to help them get rid of it, and of course, all the living creatures get rid of it, not just the US. They have suffered from what we have produced and it is our responsibility to help them, to fix our mistakes.

The climate crisis seems so far away and intangible, yet it's our generation and our children's future that will face the consequences. It seems so unreal because we don't really feel the full brunt of the crisis yet, and as Ken said, the consequences are delayed so we feel less of a sense of urgency and prioritization. The example of smoking that was mentioned in the video was very effective in visualizing the effects of delayed consequences and the guilt we would feel about leaving our children and our children's children to suffer. The thing is, many people just don't really know the specific impacts that climate change would have on future generations and think that hopefully the new technologies scientists invent in the future will solve all of the problems. Climate change isn't a problem that only scientists have to think about. It's so important that many people today are spreading awareness about the dangers of climate change and pushing the movement outside of the scientific community. I really admire what Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists are doing and I'm proud that they are representing my generation.

The Climate Crisis is not clearly understood by everyone in the world; there are people who are still learning about this issue and are figuring out ways they can address the problem. The two lecture videos provide insight into the issue and explain where it all began in time. Climate Change begins in Shakespeare's London with the Industrial Revolution where factories are brought into the scene and technology is changed forever. This is what later transforms into the Fossil Fuel Industry where many developed nations dig up coal and oil and burn all of it into the atmosphere. Sadly, the countries that are releasing the least amount of CO2 are the ones that will be facing the harshest consequences of climate change's effect. 
<br><br>
It is interesting to when you put this issue in the sense that is occurred in one lifetime because the people that were responsible for it are still alive and no substantial effort has been made to reverse the amount of CO2 produced. It has been handed down to my generation to solve the issue and demand the change that was already identified but never solved. The issue could have been avoided up to the point where we are now, yet other people's interest had been put ahead. Capitalism is a driving force behind this issue because the fossil fuel industry is continuing to poison our planet. I am devastated and am scared that the issue is getting worse, but I have optimism because like doubts in smoking cigarettes causing cancer or the ozone layer being depleted, the science pushed through to make change.
</p><hr>



<p>
Personally I had no idea that the climate crisis all happened in the span on one lifetime. For that generation to have emitted so much co2 into the atmosphere without realizing its effects and for them to be continually doing the same thing is very upsetting to say the least. They have left us with a near uninhabitable planet and have taught us to follow in the fossil fuel burning footsteps that got us to where we are now. One of the most disheartening things from the second video “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, was the reality  that the richest countries are the ones emitting the most CO2 into the atmosphere yet we are the ones receiving all the advantages from burning fossil fuels and will be able to have a certain safety net to protect us, at least for some time, from the direct affects of the climate crisis while the poorer countries suffer. Virtually half the planet had nothing to do with these emissions yet they are the ones who will suffer first from the affects. I am excited to continue taking this class to learn about ways in which we can help fight the climate issue so that future generations can enjoy the beautiful earth present generations are now enjoying.

<p>
The lectures really bring into light the Inequities of the climate crisis, not only between generations, but also the global differences in responsibility and accountability. We are now at a point where we need to face the issue head on instead of turning a blind eye. It is too late to wait for the generation that contributed the most CO2 to step up and take action, because as it was pointed out, most of them don’t care because they will not be alive to deal with the dire impacts. It is us and our children that will have to face these consequences.
</p><hr>



<p>
The fact that our country has played such an enormous roll in the climate crisis is deeply saddening. With as much wealth and power as our country has, we should be leading the fight against the doom of our planet but are instead contributing to the problem and thus hurting less advantaged countries. Disadvantaged parts of the world have done the least to cause climate change yet will suffer the worst affects of this crisis. This is incredibly unfair and speaks to the ideology of greed that our country is dominated by. I have noticed that a huge problem in this country is that many people do have a genuine passion about climate change, but many politicians wealthy people that hold the most power do not share this same passion. Without agreement from those that control the country, it is hard to make huge lasting changes such as significant reductions in carbon emissions. Of course reducing personal waste and living an individually sustainable life is very important, but I believe we need a nationwide shift in how the country is run in order to catalyze the enormous change necessary to reverse the damage we have done to the planet. We cannot sit idly by while countries that are not responsible for the crisis we are in suffer from the detrimental effects.

Before viewing this lecture and the short introductory video preceding it, I had never quite considered that the climate crisis was actually brought about in such a short period of time. I had always assumed that the rates of CO2 in the air had been rising steadily since the beginning of the industrial revolution and had finally reached a catastrophic level within the past few years. To think that such an astonishing amount of pollution and greenhouse gas emission has taken place in just 60 years, in my opinion, makes the issue seem far more dire than previously thought. If so much damage can be done in such a short amount of time, it is imperative that people are educated on this matter and that those with power and authority act to at least mitigate what could happen next.  Additionally, the fact that a mere 1/8 of the GLOBAL population is responsible for 2/3 of the greenhouse gas emissions is a terrifying statistic. This 1/8 is composed of some of the most wealthy and developed countries, and yet they are creating an issue that harms themselves and the remaining 7/8 of the world. It seems quite clear that these regions -- the US, Russia and Europe -- need to admit to the damage they are causing and begin to create concrete and efficient solutions to their damage. The rapid rate of damage and small group of culprits regarding the issue of the climate crisis points to a severe and terrifying problem, one that must be solved before this planet is truly uninhabitable.

I agree with everything that you have said. It’s very hard to believe that so much damage could be done in such a short amount of time. In the next 20 years, people in developed countries will be emitting more CO2 into the atmosphere than did people emitted in the whole of our history up until 1959 -- that’s hard to wrap my head around. There’s so much change that needs to occur and educating people is the first step. I agree that the US, Russia, and Europe need to take blame and begin changing their habits, as well as finding solutions to prevent further damage. As stated by Wallace-Wells, our planet is headed places that we do not want to be in. Simple solutions that any human being can do will help, including carpooling and turning off lights when not in use. There’s a ton of progress that needs to be made, and it needs to start now.
<br><br><hr><br>
I was also surprised that the climate crisis that we are currently facing was principally brought about during a single lifetime. Just like you, I always thought that the climate crisis began centuries ago with the industrial revolution. My previous opinion was quickly proven wrong by statistics in the video that indicate three-quarters of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere by human beings was put there the past sixty years. This really made realize the dangers of inaction or complacency. 
<br><br>
I am also astonished that the people that contributed most to the climate crisis do not seem to suffer the consequences of their actions. This is illustrated by two examples. First, the consequences of the previous generation’s unsustainably used fossil fuels are felt primarily by the subsequent generations. Second, the consequences of the high emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by developed countries are disproportionately experienced by developing countries. I was shocked to learn that the poorest three billion contributed only 5% of the greenhouse gases while the richest one billion people on the planet contribute about 50% of greenhouse gas emissions. What is even more concerning is that the poorest three billion are most at risk for the devastating impacts of climate change. This is because many developing countries are geographically located in areas of high susceptibility and are heavily dependent on stable climatic conditions to support subsistence agriculture. Moreover, many developing countries lack the resources and infrastructure needed to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Therefore, I agree that developed countries need to take responsibility and take action by first decreasing their greenhouse gas emissions and by also providing aid to the developed countries suffering the worst of the climate crisis.

The youth of today is starting to try and pick up the mess that the earlier generations have inflicted on our environment. This crisis has been caused by a generation that is still alive and they are continuing to hurt our home. It is not too late to make a change, but we need to make changes fast inorder to not create irreversible damage to our environment. The reason why this crisis came during one single lifetime due to the lack of education, and how many did not know the long lasting effects that one's actions have on our environment, and we were telling ourselves for decades we had nothing to worry about. 
 If we continue to pump all greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, like we are doing, it will have long-term, lasting effects on everywhere on the planet, and this has a time delay. The time delay is a big reason why we are in a climate crisis right now, and if these consequences were not so delayed we probably would not have been in this big of a hole of the climate. The older generations are the ones who got us into this climate crisis; it is now the younger generation's responsibility to reserve and stop the damage continuing. The young generation are the one’s who need to take action, educate the other generations, and try and fix this undeniable climate crisis going on today. We all need to try our best to live our best, sustainable life.

I enjoyed reading your thoughts on this lecture and I agree with a lot of your points. The time delay that Ken speaks about is a large reason why the majority of CO2 emissions have come within the last five decades or so as countries throughout the world continue to industrialize and develop. These emissions have to slow down drastically if we want to leave this Earth better for the generation after ourselves. Adding on to your comment about educating older generations about humans’ impact on the environment, I also think it is just as important to educate other young people on the issue. Many of us were raised to think the same way as older generations in regard to the relationship between people and the environment because our parents didn’t know any better. As you mention, it was a lack of education and awareness of older generations that helped create the world we are now in, and I think it is just as important that continue to  educate to young generations, as well as older ones, so that when our generation and the ones after us become parents they educate their kids on the problem and the cycle of ignorance ends.

I am truly moved by Professor Hiltner's apology. In all honesty, I don't blame the older generation for the use fossil fuels and coal for the duration of time when the effects of utilizing these two materials were unknown. Simply no one could've predicted the lagged detriment these materials would eventually bring upon the environment. However, I do see fault in individuals and especially corrupt corporations and politicians who have their own economic agendas, despite knowing that chaos would befall on the world if no action against climate change is taken and yet continue to exploit nature and enforce their propagandas onto the public. These people and organizations of power are, to simply put it , plain evil and possess no basic morals or consciences. 
<br><br>
In response to the developed nations being responsible for 2/3 of the carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere, I would like to apologize to the rest of the 7/8 of the world for unfairly making you pay for and live through the natural disasters and hostile environment that you are in right now. Without even reaping all the benefits of fossil fuels and coal, you are instead forced to endure the horrific pollutions and nature's rage resulting from the our exploitation of this earth. I am truly ashamed. However, on a bright note, I am happy and excited to see how my generation is responding to this crisis. We see not only the urgency but also the injustice that blatantly exist within the core of the climate crisis. I know feeling ashamed and saying sorry is simply not enough, hence we should all unite and fight this crisis not as one nation's battle, but as the battle of humankind.

I find the "Climate Crisis as a Generational Issue" video shows, maybe even glorifies, the culture of a libertarian environment, where the youth are rebelling. But it is also important to consider the youth population that ignores climate change, as the youth makes up the majority of democratic party voters. This video is hopeful in looking to our generation as the catalysts of change, but I think for true change there needs to be better education of what contributes to climate change and how climate change contributes to our daily lives so that our youth can better understand how to engage making change come about. For this, I think we should rely on the generation before us to add to this conversation. 
<br><br>
The video "How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime" I think does a better job in unifying the generations into working together by being honest and clear about how we got here, what will happen if we do not change, and how to move forward in faith. Now knowing that 1/4 of the CO2 released since 1959 was caused by the U.S. which is only four percent of the global population is a staggering disappoint. That being so disproportionate makes me upset that the U.S. is not being regulated, in that we are a major contributor of the poorest three billion who are feeling the effects of climate change the worst right now. I went back to my family's homeland in Fiji Islands this summer and I have seen the flooding and weather there with my own eyes, and watching my mom feel sad that the island is no longer what she remembers it being growing up, makes me disappointed in our actions as a society that allowed this to happen. 
<br><br>
Even though the cause of climate change can be seen as a "generational issue," I know for sure there are people who perpetuate the issue in all generations. We are all responsible and we all need to come together to solve the crisis at hand.
</p><hr>



<p>
In Professor Hiltner’s lecture video, “The climate crisis as a generational issue” just makes me feel sad. I already know some data about greenhouse gas emissions but it still makes me surprise when I saw it again. There has been such a fast increase in our carbon footprint and people have not realized what they did since it’s been hundreds of years.  Professor Hiltner should not be the one who apologies for that. In fact, we all have the responsibility for that. Especially the governments from America,  Russia, and Europe which emitted three-quarters of greenhouse gas in the world. As Professor Hiltner said, he can live at least 20 years more. Follow this trend,  CO2 could raise another 40 points. However, we as teenagers can live at least 40 years more. Think about ourselves, imagine what our life would be when we are sixty years old. It’s horrible. We can’t be so selfish like the last generation. We should also think about our children’s future. We don’t want them to live in chaos. I hope more people can watch this lecture and realize our current situation. It’s never too late for now to change.

I believe Ken makes a valiant effort to point out the flaw in our human nature up to this point. All of us are subject to greed and in most cases succumb to it with almost no hesitation or prior thought put into the consequences. In "Before the Flood" the filmmakers gave us a look at a number of politicians who are heavily supported by natural gas companies and the stances they took on the climate crisis. It was a disgusting thing to see. It is tough to imagine what would take place in such interactions and the question of brainwash or belief is constantly begged. How could we ever untangle the rope of corruption weaved through policy and policymakers alike since the dawn of industrialization? We've built our livelihood on natural gases, and it seems near impossible to imagine our race making a full 180. The issue readily reminds me of two episodes of South Park created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone (S22E6-7) where a town is ravaged by a fictional monster called ManBearPig and as people remain skeptical the monster literally tears through restaurants and homes killing everything. The media and authorities in the show play it off as school shootings (another social issue that was taken up in this season) and no one takes the issue seriously. And as the main characters try to rally support and forge a plan to take down the monster they learn that it is only there due to a legal deal made by their elder generation with the monster to protect the things they liked like new cars and fancy ice cream. And when the public is faced with a similar choice (between video games and marijuana), they decide to let the monster return at a later date so they could enjoy what they have. 
<br><br>
This brilliant joke made by the show creators syncs up perfectly with the message Ken makes in the video about our complicity with the things we enjoy and the lifestyles we lead. They had their choice and we have ours, things have to change or all the things we hold dear are endangered. It is a tough load to carry but that is why we need the aid of every human being and that much more from our developed wealthy nations if we're to see a planet past 2100.

In the first video, "the climate crisis as a general issue", it is expressed that the harm people cause to the environment will bring a great negative impact on our next generation. The video shows the different views of young people and the older generation on climate change. There are also many young people who have spontaneously organized demonstrations to express their determination to change climate change. But unfortunately, although we all want to change the problems of global warming and climate change, in this era, our daily life is inseparable from oil, and our dependence on oil is far stronger than that of the previous generation. In terms of food, people develop animal husbandry for food, which leads to ecological changes and a large number of trees are cut down. Animals also emit a lot of greenhouse gases, such as beef we eat most of the time. In order to meet people's needs, more and more people raise cattle. Cattle, on the other hand, release methane, with a "greenhouse effect potential" of 25 times that of carbon dioxide per molecule. Just like the second video "how the climate crisis was brought about in a single life" shows how we accelerated climate change in our life without knowing, such as cigarettes, not only harm people and the surrounding people's bodies but also discharge carbon dioxide, thus aggravating climate change.

<p>
to climate change. We are the younger generation who are the future of this planet and we inherited a huge problem, climate change. I never thought about how this problem did not occur because of our wrong doing and how it is not something that we asked for, but we are the ones that have to carry the burden and responsibility of saving our planet. It is up to us as the future generation to stop the planet from becoming uninhabitable. We must learn from the mistakes that our predecessors have made, and avoid doing those same mistakes that put us in this situation in the first place. The second video, “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” made some interesting points. For example, how the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere doesn’t affect the environment immediately. This point may be a bit obvious, but it makes me wonder how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have been released into our atmosphere but the consequences have not become apparent yet. The other point that struck a nerve in me is similar to that of the first video in that future generations, not just humans but animals as well, will be affected by the climate crisis despite not having anything to do with it. I became a bit worried when I saw a drastic change in PPM in only a short amount of time, and it leaves me questioning if PPM will increase at a similar rate or even faster if nothing changes in the future. PPM is something that I would love to learn more about as I have many questions about it such as: Can we lower PPM or would it just remain constant if climate change was managed? What levels of PPM would make the climate crisis irrevertible?

<p>
I always knew climate change was a big issue, but I never knew how much the country I lived in had added to it and that we were one of the main contributors to the release of Co2. When seeing the actual numbers and statistics I was very shocked and could not believe that a quarter of the CO2 emissions were put in by the U.S and that poor countries had only contributed a little as five percent. This made me sad because although they were not the main contributors to this they will suffer the consequences that the richer countries did. Not only will they suffer the consequences, but they will also suffer the worst consequences because they are poor and don’t have the resources as that of a rich country. 
<br><br>
It also frustrates me that now people want to make a change because of the damage done from older generations, and yet some of them do not believe in climate change even when they were the ones who brought upon these consequences of their actions. It is crazy to see the actual statistics and how just one lifetime has brought upon so much damage to the earth and if we continue this it will only make things worse and make the earth eventually uninhabitable. That is why it is now my generation's time to take action into our hands even if it is as small as changing our diet.
</p><hr>


<p>
I, for one, thought climate change was the result of human actions over the course of hundreds of years. I was shocked to hear that the crisis was really brought about in only a single generation. It is so unsettling to think that it could have been prevented or least been slowed down, but we are now left with a planet that is quickly becoming uninhabitable. It's a lot of pressure to place upon my generation because it is what we do, or don't do, in the coming years that will have a tremendous effect on generations to come. Though it's easy to place blame on previous generations for bringing about such a mess, I can't help but to think that I wouldn't have done any better had I been in their position. However, we can blame those who continue to live the lifestyle that brought about global warming today. We know now how our actions affect the global climate and there is no excuse to continue our harmful way of life. 
<br><br>
What I also found disturbing was the idea that such a small population in more wealthy, developed countries pumped out significantly more CO2 than the bulk of the world's population. Even more, it is those who have less that have the suffer the consequences more. It's completely selfish and the United States, among other developed countries, needs to set a better example and a higher bar for developing countries to achieve. Imagine if the whole world led the lifestyle that most Americans lead: the planet would be uninhabitable in no time.

Going off of what Matt is saying, it’s shocking to hear that climate change has, for the most part, been occuring in just the past 60 years. As Ken was saying, one of the greatest issues and reasoning for while climate change hasn’t been addressed sooner is the time delay between contributing emissions and noticing its effects. I agree with you, Matt, that our generation now has this large task upon us to correct the mistakes of our predecessors. I also agree that I can’t place blame on the past generations because they lacked the awareness and opportunities we have today. However, everyone, as inhabitants of this planet, needs to be aware of the environmental issues we’re facing and come together to take action.  
<br><br>
Touching up on your second point, it’s sad to think about how wealthy nations take advantage of the poor. Developing nations are used as scapegoats for environmental issues caused by developed countries. To make it even worse, wealthy nations pollute the poorer countries sending them trash, recyclables, and e-waste to be disposed off. This is just one example of environmental racism and toxic colonialism, which are reinforced by government, economic, political, and military institutions. So along with the issue of climate change, we face the issue of environmental justice. Your comment about the United States being selfish reminds me of the part in the film, Before the Flood, where the woman in India was saying that the people in her country just want the luxuries the US takes for granted everyday, such as electricity. In order to curb climate change, the US is going to have to take a step back and change its consumption of things from fossil fuel to food.

I think considering climate change as a generational issue is an important outlook that not a lot of people adopt. When I think of climate change and our current environmental state, I tend to blame individual, large corporations because it's easier to assign blame to a large entity rather than blame individual people. I definitely did not consider climate change to be be a generational issue where older generations' inability to act conscientiously affects our current generation. I appreciate that Ken recognizes that a lot of our current problems could have been prevented or lessened if older generations had practiced and passed on sustainable habits. I especially liked Ken's analogy of the average adult that smoked cigarettes and how he/she/they didn't feel any affects, but everyone in the generation after feels the aftershocks of their action. This analogy does a really good job illustrating the delay in effects that a lot of climate change problems feel. 
<br><br>
Something that shocked me about this video were the numbers stated. While the US, EU, and Russia account for 1/8 of the world's population, these powerful, developed countries are responsible for 2/3 rds of the overall CO2 emissions in the world. What's particularly disheartening that even though these few countries are the culprits, all nations are suffering. In fact, those who live in poverty often deal with the effects the most, even though it is not their actions that have led to their suffering. It makes me think that these people are the ones suffering from the most environmental injustice. 
<br><br>
Overall, this take on climate change and the apology from Ken is powerful. It gives us the metric of lifetimes and generations and humanizes the element of time in the issue that is climate change.
</p><hr>



<p>
In this video, “The climate crisis is a general issue”, Ken talks about the future influences of the climate crisis. Even if our world switch to renewable energy instead of using gasoline that produces so much pollution, the influences of the climate crisis will still last for a few generations. The U.S is responsible for 25 percent of the CO2, Asia and Europe are responsible for ⅔ of the world. This tells why our world is turning to bad place to live and it’ll be harder for our next generations to survive. There is already a huge disaster in Australia, the big fire causes hundred millions of wild animals’ death. And the big fire is still going on, the color of the sky turns yellow, the temperature of the Australia goes up drastically. This is not the worst part, the prime minister of Australia is spending his holiday somewhere else. So we can’t see people are taking this problem seriously.

As Professor Hiltner addresses the climate crisis he communicates how the climate crisis was caused in a single lifetime, which is startling because despite fossil fuels having been burned for longer it is because the generational behavior that have caused an exponential increase in CO2 in the atmosphere. However, he also brings up an important point that today's society and youth and being raised with the same fossil fuel addition.
<br><br>
Despite their being a rise in awareness and Climate Strikes inspired by Greta Thunberg, there is still more to be done. As Ken points out that the developed world is responsible for roughly ⅔ of global CO2 emissions, which is astonishing but also it shows the huge impact the citizens of the United States have. While 3 billion of the poorest people contribute to only 5%. As we continue to idolize lavish lifestyles, with mansions, multiple cars, large closets we are only adding to the problem. Our generation is growing up believing that their self worth can be judged on whether or not they are wearing the trendiest sneakers. In order to promote change we must as a society regroup and delve upon what we truly value on this Earth. 
<br><br>
After watching this video I am driven to advocate for change. As a generation I have hope that we will unite and transform this planet for the better. Although, always daunting at the beginning it is comforting to know that there are people who are ready to change, even those who were once contributors to the problem are now becoming the solution.
</p><hr>



<p>
As a film major, I study the narrative patterns and the movie making formula. Attending Ken's lectures and watching his videos has created a mental movie in my head and I am the main character. Right now it feels like we are living in a flashback in a dystopian film. I cant shake this feeling that first world countries will continue to destroy our earth and eventually our kids will be living in a mad max world, and my existence in this class was just exposition to explain our negligence regarding the biggest threat to humanities existence. For instance, I believe Ken's example using the cigarette is how the majority of the people around me including myself feel about the issue of climate change. I cannot say that I or any of my friends have made any significant actions in pursuit of fighting climate change because we share this sentiment, that "not my lifetime not my problem". We live in an area with little pollution and are surrounded by nature. If we actually saw the effects of climate change first hand, I believe it would spark inspiration that will help us avoid the the end of apocalypse film we just started shooting.

The lectures "The Climate crisis as a generational issue" and "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" speak out and introduce the climate crisis from the point of view from the previous generation and the rise of the use of fossil fuels that rose the level of CO2 within the atmosphere. There is an explanation of how there could have been action taken previously to help prevent the issues that most likely hurt and face the newer generation, but how no action was taken and now things have gotten significantly worse. There is also the discussion that the major developed countries such as the United States and Europe, alongside Russia, account for about 2/3rd of the amount of CO2 that rises into the atmosphere. This brings the idea that the rich are responsible for majority of the climate crisis, while the poorer people have contributed very little, however, they will be the ones to face most of the reproductions first.
</p><hr>



<p>
The thought that the climate crisis was caused within a single lifetime is a terrifying thought – we are the destroyers of our own lives, and are still making it worse to this day. It seems as though capitalism is ripping apart a home that we were meant to have for a long time, and that we are bringing about our own extinction. Shorterm it can seem as though we are fine – but once we see the decades long effects, it brings into focus the dire situation we are in, as expressed by Professor Hiltner. It appears as though we will have to face the consequences during our lifetimes, and we have to try and stop it before it gets worse.

<p>
In Hiltner’s lecture video, “The climate crisis as a generational issue”, he reflects on the anger that has filled younger generations over the state of our planet. I attended the Climate Strike in Santa Barbara in the spring of 2019 and listened to many motivational speakers from various organizations rally the strikers with stirring words. However, what moved me most was when two children about the age of 10 stood in front of the crowd and spoke. At such a young age, these children were extremely passionate about the protection of the environment, as they are aware that they will feel the effects more heavily than anyone. It brought me almost to tears to imagine how they may interpret their futures, helpless. Politicians have been very reluctant to take measures into their own hands, and enact change via institution. Many of these politicians are in fact middle aged, and older, who do not see the impending issue of climate change, as they may believe it does not affect them directly. Additionally, they know that investing in sustainable technologies and research will not reap the same economic benefits as the fossil fuels detraction.
<br><br>
 Furthermore, after reading the “Uninhabitable Earth” and watching the documentary Before the Flood, it is clear that within the next century, it is likely that we will run out of these fossil fuels that are so lucrative to our economy. However, that is not a problem for older generations, as they will be long gone. 
 <br><br>
 In Hiltner’s video “How the climate change was brought about in a single lifetime”, he mentions that there is a significant time delay before the consequences of carbon emissions are felt; this is another factor as to why older generations have felt that climate crisis discourse is overly dramatic, because their effects have been long in coming. However, as natural disasters and sweeping weather patterns have become increasingly prevalent in recent years, more people are beginning to realize the climate crisis epidemic. Critics of climate change often blame this occurrence as natural patterns of nature, or completely turn a blind eye. “The Uninhabitable Earth” mentions that a big part of the reason that we deny the degree to which climate changes our planet is because we assume that its effects will hit hardest elsewhere. That is, until the effects become so extreme, that they are felt in everyone’s backyards. It is then clear that soon enough climate change will affect the public on a personal level, and it is up to us to minimize these impacts.

I agree entirely when you said, "What moved me the most was two children about the age of 10 stood in front of the crowd and spoke. At such a young age, these children were extremely passionate about the protection of the environment, as they are aware that they will feel the effects more heavily than anyone." It is extremely disturbing to realize that the problems the older generations have created will profoundly impact the lives of the future generations, who are being born into a world that is doomed with an uncertain future. The youth of today have to find methods to combat climate change and plead with politicians to ACT. To persuade them to do something about the problem THEY created.
<br><br><hr><br>
I was mainly interested in your comment because I was wondering how that climate strike in SB was? I was so excited to go, but had to work unfortunately. Do you think the younger voices behind the climate crisis could have more of an effect on the politicians in the world?
<br><br><hr><br>
I find it very interesting that you were so struck by the participation and passion of 10 year old children at the Climate Strike. I similarly imagine such young children worrying about the climate crisis and am amazed by their involvement but simultaneously heartbroken because I feel that kids should be free of such worries so early in their life. However, this is the world they are inheriting, and I also have to place myself beside them as a 20 year old student. If I and so many of my college peers feel hopeless after reading one article and a few films/videos, I can only imagine how they must spend their childhood hours. While I appreciate Ken's sincere apology as a member of the generation that contributed the most to the climate crisis, I cannot help but to think that blaming this previous generation is missing the point. The people who should be apologizing are not those who unknowingly developed and fed their fossil fuel addictions before we had the knowledge and experience of its effects on the world. The people who should be apologizing are those who continue to feign ignorance in the face of all we now know, those who tell our young people and leaders like Greta Thunberg to go back to school and stay out of politics and protests when this is our future at stake. Politicians who serve immediate private interests, support the fossil fuel industry for monetary gain and deny climate change for re-election are the ones who will go down in history as villains. In the meantime, I have to have hope that the next generation will be able to make the change necessary to fight this issue. The footage of the Climate Strike and your story of your experience with the protests and those children does exactly that so thank you.

This video is extremely powerful, and it is devastating to think that the climate crisis was created in a single lifetime. Ken uses his age as the mark for climate change, and his single lifetime statement is very shocking, but even more so when you calculate that he is only about 60 years old, and so the ¾ of CO2 emitted by humans becomes an even more appalling number. I had always wondered why no one had delayed, or stopped it before, and the analogy of the cigarettes story explained it very well. Forty or fifty years ago people didn’t think about the consequences of their actions, and they certainly didn’t think they’d have to worry about the planet’s future. This also explains the generational split on the climate change topic today. Along with notes I took during lecture, I finally understand what greenhouse gases are, and why methane, and more so CO2, are so deadly. 
<br><br>
It is also very unfair how the U.S. is the cause of ¼ of all CO2 released while it only constitutes 4% of the world’s population, while the poorest 3 billion people on the planet only contributed 5% of CO2. As Ken points out, almost ½ of the world didn’t add much, and yet they and generations after them will suffer the effects of climate change primarily caused by 1st world countries. Ken’s apology was my favorite part of the video. It shows he truly cares about the planet and about the people. It was very impactful and respectable. Usually older generations avoid taking responsibility, but Ken gave such a well worded and sincere apology he makes up for all the others.

I found this lecture to be quite informative about how the climate crisis was brought about. I particularly liked the smoking analogy since it can oftentimes be difficult to convey how past generations' actions have created problems in the contemporary world. I do disagree, however, on the focus of blaming past generations. While it may have been their fault that the climate crisis has reached such a critical point, I don't believe that their actions intended to have such consequences. There are many technological advances that occurred that I would argue were necessary but resulted in negative effects on the climate. One example that comes to mind are airplanes. Planes burn tons of gallons of jet fuel and release CO2 into the atmosphere everyday. Though the CO2 emissions from jets are very bad for the atmosphere, airplanes greatly helped advance our society. So, while past generations are technically at fault for a large part of what contributed to the climate crisis, I simply cannot blindly blame them without realizing that destroying the planet was not their intention and recognizing the many ways we have also benefited from their actions.

I agree with you. We cannot solely blame the previous generations for the creation of life-changing technology that had unforeseen consequences. They were not aware of how it could affect the planet, and the generations today are also able to benefit from their advancements, thus we cannot blame them, and instead should just acknowledge the problem and focus on how we could all try to fix it together.

In “the climate crisis as a general issue,'' Hiltner mentions that people of his generation failed to act on the climate crisis, and still are not adequately acting. It doesn’t make sense to me how even though that generation is aware that their actions have had negative effects on the environment, some of them still do not take action or even do their part now. It seems like common sense to me that if we caused something that detrimental to the earth, we should all do something to reverse it.
<br><br>
In “how the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” Hiltner explains that corporations kept dumping CO2 in the atmosphere because they didn’t see immediate repercussions. It makes sense because they thought they had more room than they did in the atmosphere. The significant time delay between the CO2 emissions and the consequences of those emissions allowed people to think they weren’t causing that much damage. If the effects of releasing CO2 into the atmosphere were seen or felt immediately, there would have been a quicker change in their methods. The example Hiltner used to explain the previous generation’s cause of global warming perfectly captured their role. Smoking multiple packs of cigarettes per day but feel no physical repercussions themselves, only to have their kids be born with the health problems caused by smoking. My generation was born into this crisis without causing it, and it is now our responsibility to reverse the effects.

Professor Ken's in-depth analysis of climate change being a generational issue was absolutely fascinating and heartbreaking at the same time.  When taking into consideration how much trouble the planet is in, as a result of one lifetime of pollution, is absolutely horrifying. Similarly, the thought that future generations won't be able to experience their natural surroundings as much as I have, while having to fend off the worst of climate change is devastating. I would prefer that my generation collectively begins to correct the mistakes of the past, rather than be of a generation of Americans that chose to ignore our planet's struggle and stay on the sidelines. Hopefully, classes like English 23 (Climate Change) continue to educate and remind us of the importance of actively taking up the responsibility of bettering our world, for us and the future. 
<br><br>
Additionally, information like this makes me ponder, "Why doesn't our country begin leading the world in the reduction of our carbon footprint?" Hopefully, the next president of our nation begin to enforce the necessity for change.

The climate crisis is one that, in my opinion, was prophesied at the start of our very existence as a species. We as a race are unsustainable. Since the beginning of our time on earth, we have evolved to take from the planet and see it as a resource to abuse rather than a necessity to protect. As society advanced, our addiction to all things bad for the earth such as fossil fuels and industrialization only grew stronger. Now, we have reached the point where we are dealing with the consequences of our ancestors. 
<br><br>
At the beginning of industrialization, the negative effects may not have been apparent. Now we are in a very tough position because we know the science behind the theoretical dangers and we can actually see the destruction and impending doom that comes from the climate crisis, but we are only accustomed to this one unsustainable way of life. As Ken stated, we have inherited the previous generation’s fossil fuel addiction and we have the habit of “casually abusing the planet.” We as a generation are in a very tricky spot because we see how our normal way of life is seriously impacting the planet. We were taught a certain way of life, but our predecessors living this way only left a catastrophic mess for us. We know no other way to live, yet it is now our responsibility to clean up the damage already done and completely rewire the way that we live. 
<br><br>
The climate crisis was born in one lifetime, dooming countless generations to come. We must be a catalyst for change having seen and learned from the mistakes of those before us because we have to change the way we live. If a pipe bursts and your entire home is flooding, no matter how much water you clean up the damage will only stop once you fix the pipe. Our job isn’t just to clean up after the past generations. Our job is to completely revolutionize and fix the way we survive as a species.

After watching the video “How the Climate Crisis was brought about in a single lifetime,” I have profoundly noticed how humans are responsible for the climate crisis. Climate change does not happen in one night; it is a result of decades of human activities that destroy the environment and produce harmful gases to the world. Not just the previous generation are responsible for climate change; we are all responsible for it. Just as the example which Ken said in the video, it’s like a person smoking without any consequences to himself but to the next generations. As the consequences of climate change will delay, we have not realized this crisis in time. For decades, humans have become addicted to the use of fossil fuels and the convenience which fossil fuels have brought to us. Referring to the video by Ken, the carbon dioxide level has tripled and risen by 100ppm in just 60 years. This is just how bad our addiction to fossil fuels is. Unfortunately, no one is willing to give up the comfortable living standard which it has brought to us. We must find a solution or alternative which we can turn to and replace fossil fuels. Renewable energy like solar energy and wind power are what humans are working on. I am looking forward to seeing that humans can rely on other forms of renewable energy.

What was especially striking to me about "How the Climate Crisis was brought about in a single lifetime," was how Ken described our addiction to fossil fuels. I agree with what Sammi talked about regarding no one wanting to give up the comfortable standard of living through the mass burning of fossil fuels. It truly is hard to imagine without things that rely on fossil fuels. Electricity for example, despite increasingly used renewables, still requires large amounts of fossil fuel consumption. Life without a good bit of our electricity certainly would be an adjustment and getting large amounts of people all to change would be quite difficult almost unreasonable, especially when it's regarding our addiction. 
<br><br>
The unique aspect of this addiction is that we're seeing the consequences decades after starting. This makes me ponder if we're too late already. If we're now feeling the consequences of decades past, will the decades future, even with serious action taken still feel the burden of climate change? In lecture Ken talked about how eventually, Earth's systems will take over and start putting more greenhouses into the atmosphere and taking out less, placing life in a vicious cycle. Despite this, I like to keep an optimistic view that it's not too late to make a change.

“The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” talks about which people did and are still destroying the earth. Professor made a great job of appealing to emotions to those people who are dealing damages to the earth. He appeals this problem to a greater and farther view: Today's damage to the earth such as the release of CO2 will cause our children and all the children in later few hundred years suffered. And the effect of CO2 did increase a lot from just a few decade ago. Undoubtly, we need to stop those people mentioned by Ken in his video causing the damage( CO2) to the earth. As students in this class, and children in 20th centuries, we need to let the people from Ken's generation felt about their mistakes and made their apologies as soon as possible. And we need to do as well as we can to protect the earth and to live a little more greenly.

What I think Professor Ken Hiltner did especially well in his "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" video was how he used metaphors explaining the damage of the delayed effects of CO2.  He compared it to second hand smoke which is not only metaphorically but almost literally what has been done but at a global  scale where future generations around the world will feel the effects of for most of their lives.  The adults had put their children in a dangerous environment by releasing toxic chemicals for their own comfort at the expense of their children’s well being.   What I thought was especially shocking was how CO2 levels have risen from 315 ppm to 415 ppm within a single lifetime, yet the public has still failed to effectively mobilize against further increase of these grim numbers.   In addition, I also thought it was very interesting how the privileged individuals who had contributed most to climate change will most likely be least affected by the damage that global warming will cause.  Meanwhile the three billion people who contributed only 5% to CO2 emissions will feel the worst of it.  
<br><br> 
As you had said, Professor Ken Hiltner also did a very good job with appealing to the audience's emotions.  He chose very personal subjects like using his own birth year to represent his generation, and then to attempt to apologize on their behalf for their recklessness in how they had treated the world and its environment.  I thought it was especially heart warming to hear how he had claimed that now many of his generations will do their best to try to at least mitigate what they had started, although the damage may become irreversible.
<br><br><hr><br>

I completely agree that, just as Ken has done, folks from the generation that allowed for the genesis of climate crisis should go forth and apologize for what they’ve done, but I would also urge for a call to action. Though apologizing is the first step, without doing anything those words are empty. Our generation is bearing the brunt of the damage that has been done, and saying sorry doesn’t take that weight off our shoulders. Ken also talked about the passing down of humans’ addiction to fossil fuels, which, when you think about the smoking metaphor he used, means that our generation will still have to be the one to kick the habit, all while repairing the damage that we had no control over. 
<br><br>
I think the play to emotions that Ken went after here was good, however I’m cautious to accept that at face value. I have no doubts that Ken himself is, obviously, attempting to fix what has been done, but I can’t say the same for the rest of his generation. Climate change is not a youth issue, it’s a human issue, and simply accepting responsibility isn’t enough to manufacture change.
<br><br><hr><br>
The people causing the most damage to the Earth are the inhabitants of the United States, which, as pointed out in this video, is an unbelievably small part of the world's population to be contributing so much damage. The point made about our children and their children feeling the effects of the past generation's poor handling of the environment was made interestingly by the cigarette comparison. If someone was told that them smoking cigarettes wouldn't affect them at all, but would affect all of their future generations, they would most likely decide not to do it, or at least be a lot more cautious of it. I didn't realize before how delayed the effects of climate change are, and I think a lot of people are enjoying claiming that all of our damage is just built up from the past, but demonstrating how much CO2 in ppm has been added to the atmosphere in a single lifetime kind of debunks that idea that it's just the way it's been when we're excelling a lot faster than we have in the past when it comes to our greenhouse gas output.
<br><br>
Asking people from past generations to apologize is a nice idea, but in all honesty it's not going to change the damage that has been done, and currently we can't be complaining about whose fault it is in terms of generationally, we need to just be working towards a solution. If the older generation can get on board and help out along with the fired up younger generation, then we may be on to something.
<br><br><hr><br>
 In watching both videos, i agree with you in that the description of which factors lead to the type of problems dealt with due to climate changes is done superbly by Hitlner.  Of all the emotions i felt, fear for the future took me first in that I was afraid at our own generational failure. Instead of the possibility of imminent death in the face of the younger (my own)  generation, i felt fear that my own generation would succumb to that same stand still attitude. 
<br><br>
Today we have amazing youth leaders like Greta Thurnburg fighting for climate change activism, but for the most part I see little to no direct, congregated action being taken in opposition against Climate change from today's generation. While yes, our own battle against climate change may differ greatly from Ken Hiltner's generation, one fact remains true: our inaction and inability  to mobilize will speak volumes of regretful message to the future generation.
<br><br>
 In the past lifetime, we have seen our own changes in society from the civil rights movement to the clear increase of carbon emissions in the atmosphere. Almost like a sibling generation to the previous generation of Climate change disaster, we are gifted with the ability of hindsight. When all is said and done, we are the one's who will inherit this earth and pass on. Rather than dwell on previous generations mistakes, we should look for ways where the new generation can take away from the old and work towards a better climate.
<br><br><hr><br>
Of course, and we must help people like Ken to help call out for this issue and try to make a difference> it is not a problem of right or wrong, what matters is we need to protect our mutual home and give it a better future.

I find it both hard to believe and not hard to believe that a single lifetime has brought about such devastating amounts of CO2 to the Earth. Humans are the most selfish beings. The time delay might have played a role in bringing about the climate crisis, but it is ultimately our doing even today. In today’s society, with all this knowledge and visible devastation of climate change, the climate crisis is still being treated as a topic of discussion and not of unison action. It is hard to feel optimistic with people in power constantly showing they only care about money. But the generational split does give me faith. It is the younger generation that is truly passionate about making the change that is needed for the survival of the Earth and ours. The number of years it can remain in the atmosphere shocks me as well. We cannot keep releasing more knowing how long it can remain.

<p>
There is a point in the lecture that really interest me. There is a significant delay between the cause and the consequence in terms of pollution, and this delay tend to drive people to simply neglect the very small change during a short period of time such as a decade. However, changes in quantity, no matter how small it is, will finally lead to a change in quality. If we do nothing, people won’t realize how severe our situation is until the fatal consequence start to show up. By then, it would be too late to save our environment. If we could publicize the possible consequence and allow more people to admit that it is the situation that we are facing, we would have a better chance to save our environment. 
<br><br>
When I heard that most of the pollution was caused by a very small proportion of the human population, I felt embarrassed and ashamed. I recall a survey I participated in EEMB W22, by entering the estimated amount of food I eat, traffic I use, and electricity I consume, etc., the survey calculated that it would take more than 5 earths to support human beings if everyone lives like I do. I asked my friends to do the survey, and they surprisingly found that their lifestyles costs 5-9 earths. I want to say that it’s not just the top 4%, but every one of us who is living a satisfying life should account for the climate change. We all must do what we can to reduce carbon emissions to safe the planet. It doesn’t mean that we must no longer drive a car or use electric devices, but we must start small to make a small reduction in everything we consume and pollute. All of us together, would make a big difference.

Professor Hiltner does a nice job at summing up the issue of climate change and how we got to where we are today. People in the developed world, especially the United States, caused a large portion of the problem in the world and are responsible for the majority of the damage that has been caused. Rather than blaming the previous generation, I consider politicians to be a major part of the problem. While it is true that everyone is responsible for contributing to climate change, I believe that people in power who make policies or deny the existence of climate change are more to blame, especially those they are bought and influenced by large fossil fuel corporations. The fate of the planet may seem dreary, but there is still some hope left if we start making changes to our lifestyles and policies regarding fossil fuel consumption.
<br><br>
I thought that it was really interesting how Professor Hiltner used the example of smoking to compare it to the issue of climate change. I never considered climate change that way and it really put the issue at hand into a new perspective for me. He does a really good job at using smoking as an analogy to climate change because people do not really think of the consequences of their action. They do not stop to consider the negative impacts they have on the people around them.
</p><hr>



<p>
I believe a main reason for the vast anthropogenic climate damage is the notion of out of sight out of mind. These lectures cover this topic and perfectly illustrate the issue with the cigarette analogy. I believe people will only take action if the consequences directly affect them. This is why  environmental hazards are distributed so disproportionately across the globe. The leaders of wealthy corporations do not mind the pollution they are adding to the planet because they are not the ones struggling to breathe. Its ironic that the world's richest cause the most pollution and have the largest footprints yet they're the ones who remain impervious to most of the consequences, for now at least. The hypercapitalist mentality that spawned in the 20th century led to business practices with solely profit on the mind. Corporations are willing to cause the environment great harm if it offers them the slightest leg up in the business world. This is why I feel so scared for the state of our planet: corporations are so unregulated that I fear they have no incentive to operate more sustainably and will continue to cause massive pollution. This is exacerbated by the fact that in the United States the current administration is supporting big industries that do not consider their environmental ramifications, or worse, choose to ignore them. Although my generation was born into this problem, I do not think that removes our responsibility for us to take action. We simply do not have time to leave this issue for the next generation. The fossil fuel powered lifestyle of the past century offered comfort and luxury but now its consequences are being felt and the most heavily impacted are the ones who never really reaped the benefits of fossil fuels. Small, undeveloped countries are being struck the hardest by the results of environmental damage yet they're the ones who have the smallest footprints. I think that in order to enact any real change on this subject there needs to be greater accountability not only on an individual scale but also on a corporate one.

I really liked the cigarette smoking analogy. It makes the climate crisis much more tangible as an injustice done by one group of people on another. I believe many older people do not feel guilty about what they've done since they do not understand it well enough. Most people would feel bad about hurting their children and future generations, so I doubt older generations simply do not care and are heartless. I love my grandparents and respect my elders, but I think it is too late to inform them and try to make them feel guilty for what they've done. Scientists have known about climate change since the 50's, but for some reason it has remained unpopular. I also like how you brought up the unfairness of the climate crisis. The richest in the world have been benefitting from fossil fuels for a hundred years while hurting themselves as well as the poor, who received nothing. The world is unjust, but I hope this generation and future generations are more selfless.

In the “The Climate Crisis as a generational issue” lecture and “How the Climate Crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” lecture, the lectures emphasizes how the older generations abuse of substances and fossil fuels economy can negatively affect the future generations in multiple ways. In the “How the Climate Crisis was Brought about in a Single Lifetime” lecture, it emphasizes how PPM increased tremendously from 1959 to 2019. It went from 315 to 415 PPM which was a 100 PPM increase, and it demonstrates how a single lifetime can dramatically affect the world in negativeways. I was inspired and frightened to have learned this information because I want to try to make the world a better place, but to see the world falling apart is very depressing. We are constantly making the world harder to repair.In addition, the United States are responsible for 25% of the CO2, as Europe and Asia are responsible for ⅔. This demonstrates how we constantly are making the world harder to survive and function. I am really inspired to learn the solutions on how to depreciate the PPM and ways to make the world more healthy and less abuse on substances. As well, it is frightening to see how the PPM to increase to be approximately is 455. These videos demonstrate how a single person can make a difference and their lifetime actions can also impact the economy. We should all be accountable for how the world is now and make a change moving forward. I understand that the older generations did made a negative influence, but we should use that as a guideline how to make the world more successful.
<br><br>
 When the lectures emphasized how the  old generation’s actions can actually impact the upcoming generations, I was interested in how he gave the example of smoking. It can affect genetically with the body when the person has kids leading to having birth defects, but it can also affect the people around you. It opens my eyes to how something so small can actually make a big difference in the life we live. It made me watch my actions and question myself as a person to make sure that my actions are positively influencing the next generations.I was also interested how in the video, it emphasizes the fossil fuels economy makes an impact in the future. I want to learn what are the possible solutions to improve fossil fuel economy and depreciate abuse substances.

I love all of your optimism! Instead of getting mad at the older generation for the mistakes they made regarding the climate, we can choose to view their mistakes as learning lessons, as a blueprint for what not to do. It's important to realize how everyone's part matters and how simple lifestyle changes can have profound effects on the world at large.I commend Professor Hiltner for being quick to apologize for his generation's mistakes. I think a big reason why many people in the older generation don't choose to fully recognize what their generation did is because they feel ashamed. However, the past is in the past. All that matters is what we do moving forward.

The youth are rebelling because we are very concerned about the state of our planet and its climate. I understand how we’ve sadly gotten to this point, but I don’t understand why we are still not doing nearly enough to stop it. Decades of inaction have resulted in suffering generations of people, animals, and plants, so I agree with Ken that radical change is necessary. What saddens me the most is that developing countries are paying the price for my country’s actions. Not only are their living conditions already tough, but they will not be able to protect themselves against the extreme weather patterns and natural disasters that are to come. Developed countries are to blame for anthropogenic climate change. In the end, though, everyone will suffer if we continue releasing fossil fuels into the atmosphere at the same rate. I appreciate Ken’s apology about the damage boomers have contributed to our planet. Back then, they didn’t understand the consequences of their actions. However, the ramifications of the fossil fuel industry have become abundantly clear. We don’t have to waste waiting for youth leaders to be elected into authoritative positions. Those who have the power to actually do something need to step up now.
</p><hr>



<p>
The lecture video “The climate crisis as a generational issue” talks about how the youth is rebelling due to the older generation not acting up when they were supposed to. In the video, Ken says that for decades people have said they needed to change the way they recklessly inhabit the planet, but they never did, which is why the younger generation is now rebelling. The pressure to act up and create change has now fallen onto the younger generation, which is why their rebellion has come up. The lecture video “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” talks about how the climate crisis came to be in a lifetime and how it was never stopped. One part I found interesting was at the beginning when Ken mentions how the consequences of pouring oil into a storm drain are noticeable right away, but releasing a ton of CO2 into the air isn’t as noticeable. This leads to people telling themselves that it isn’t that bad and they don’t have to worry, but they do. The United States, Europe, and Russia are responsible for two thirds of all CO2 emitted into the atmosphere even though there are home to only one eighth of the world’s population. The poorest three billion people in the world only emit five percent of all CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, but they are the ones affected the most.

These two lectures by Ken frame the climate crisis in the same way that I’ve always seen it; as a generational issue. The knowledge about climate change has been present for over 50 years, within the lifetime of Ken and most of our parents. During this time, companies such as Exxon Mobil have admitted climate change existed, admitted that fossil fuels were a major factor, and then subsequently denied and retracted all of their previous confirmations on the matter. Ken and our parent’s entire lives have existed in a country being strategically fed lies by the fossil fuel industry and its cronies in a strategic move to buy themselves as much profitable time as possible to continue “business as usual” before Americans and people around the globe start encountering the delayed consequences of their actions in what is now the present day. 

<br><br>
For our generation, this means trying to convince many of the misinformed and naive members of the previous generation, and scrambling to undo all of the damage done to American consumption behaviors by the fossil fuel industry. As one of the largest contributors in the world, the U.S. must take some responsibility and start making some concrete changes in policy to encourage changes in consumption behavior and a switch to renewable energy before it is too late.

In the lecture video, “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” I was surprised by the fact that the U.S only makes up 4% of the world’s population and yet a quarter of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere comes from the U.S. It is unfair that people who live in poverty don’t contribute to global warming as much as the people in developed countries do and yet the poorest people are the ones who are suffering the most. This lecture really made me think about how our generation is fighting hard to make our voices heard about our concern of the climate crisis. On the other hand, even though we don't want to admit, my generation is also addicted to fossil fuel. Just like how Professor Ken stated in his lecture, we grew up with fossil fuel and didn’t realize the damage until later on in our lives when the addiction is already established. That is why my generation is always protesting and standing up for what we believe is right, because we know that our actions are also going to affect the future generations and we don’t want to stay in the same path as the older generations. This brings up the question that I have been thinking about: Do I want to have children some time in the future? Now, this is a question I think about a lot because I’m unsure about earth’s conditions in future years. I’m terrified about the idea of my future children or grandchildren having to fight for their lives one day due to climate change. My generation is going to bring in innocent lives on earth that had nothing to do with pollution, carbon dioxide, and the ice melting. It is insane how people take earth for granted and don’t think about how we are the target if we don’t take action now. Furthermore, I strongly believe that climate change is tied with social status. Wealthy people tend to not really think about climate change because they have the means to protect themselves in case of a flood, hurricane, fire, etc. Not only are wealthy people able to protect themselves but they also pollute carbon the most than any other social class without realizing. According to CNN Health, “...the average carbon footprint of someone in the world’s richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%”. Meaning all the mansions, expensive cars, and flying around the world has a bigger impact than what we think. However, rich people are able to help out a lot too if they spend wisely. If their money is used for purchasing solar panels for their homes, electric cars, buying products that are more sustainable, and less flying around, then  higher social classes can help us to protect the earth.

I agree with a lot of what you are saying. How our generation has grown up using the products started during our parents life because we know nothing else. Along with this I agree that it is our generations turn to act because we know a lifestyle using fossil fuels is wrong. I was also shocked by the fact that a small population of people are contributing to the majority of CO2. Which is horrible for the places feeling the affects the worst due to us. One thing I wanted to add about this is how we are trying to not only change our lifestyles but other countries as well. But what I am curious about is since we built our strong economy using fossil fuels how are we supposed to tell developing countries to not do so? As a country we are being hypocrites, therefore I am not sure the solution to this. We cannot allow them to cause the same damage we did, while at the same time do first world countries have the means to help these places grow sustainably? Another fact that I found interesting to do with future generations. That is the kids of our future will suffer, but not just ours, kids across the world. Children who are among the poorest countries and only emitted 5% of the CO2 will suffer just as much as America's kids who emitted ¼. The video states they may even suffer more because they will not have the means for any resources. While people who remain in first world countries will continue to have more money and resources.

<br><br><hr><br>
I also feel very conflicted about whether to start a family and bring children into this world that is seemingly dying. While having kids could possibly create another generation of scientists and politicians who can work towards repairing the damage that generations before them have caused, it could also go in the opposite, more frightening way. My fear is that bringing more people into this world will just worsen the issue and even further overpopulate the planet, worsening the issues we are already seeing. Also, we currently are already seeing horrible effects on health and lifestyle because of climate change and they are only expected to get worse and I don’t want to have kids that live in a world without being able to experience its nature for what it has been. 
<br><br>
I also found it very interesting what you mentioned about the carbon footprints of the wealthy versus those of the poor. The fact that the footprint of a wealthy person could be 175 times that of a poor person is horrible because it is a fact that most of the environmental burden falls on people in poorer parts of the world who don’t have the money or tools to deal with the consequences that weren’t necessarily caused by them. This is a question of environmental justice and in order to fix this inequality, we must bring it to the eyes of the people. Most people don’t understand or don’t see that environmental injustice is an issue, therefore no one is doing anything about it. If this problem is communicated to the public, we can hope that people will make change and open their eyes to what is really happening to our planet by seeing that there are consequences to our actions even if they don’t affect every individual directly.

I definitely agree that climate change is a generational issue, when I talk to my friend's parent/ grandparents about why I stopped eating meat, they just laugh and say I’m being dramatic. I really did not realize how many people turn a blind eye to the climate change crisis. Luckily my grandparents are also environmental activists, but not until they realized that they were affecting future generations . My favorite quote I have seen about climate change is "You'll die from old age, but I may die from climate change". This short quote really struck me when I first read it, I had to think about what my own future may look like due to the climate changing. 
<br><br>
I grew up appreciating nature, by going camping, white water rafting, hiking, surfing, snowboarding, etc., I was taught to enjoy the outdoors respectfully. My grandma was a peacetime baby right after WWII, and she grew up very different than I did. Factories and industries popped up everywhere when she was growing up, everything became easily accessible and cheap, but at what cost. I personally do not eat meat and try to stay away from products that are "fast". My grandparents have had the largest influence on my childhood and my appreciation of nature. Without their experiences in a carbon rich world and their changes, I wouldn't have known that my actions directly affect the Earth.

What moved me most of all throughout this lecture video was Ken’s relation of his own lifespan to the progression of CO2 levels in the atmosphere and consequential apology to our generation. The reference of something literal and obvious such as smoking cigarettes to the impact of fossil-fuel use throughout the generations was quite moving and helped add further understanding to the crisis we’re facing. A reasonable human being wouldn’t smoke cigarettes at the expense of all other beings, yet we’re all smoking the metaphorical cigarette now, every day. As for his apology, it was refreshing and calming to hear someone finally step up and take some semblance of responsibility, acknowledgement, and regret for their actions, in a world that few people do such.

I also really connected with Ken’s smoking analogy to illustrate the effects of environmentally unsustainable lifestyles on later generations. I never placed much blame on the generations before me, as I understand that it wasn’t a conscience decision on their part to leave the world in a state of crisis, but the connection to smoking helped me to realize the severity of the situation. Especially when you consider that the scientific community has known about and tried to warn the world about the coming climate crisis for decades, the inaction of my elders seems completely irresponsible. It was hypocritical to claim that they wanted a better world for their children (something I remember hearing a lot as a child) but refused to acknowledge the biggest threat that we will face as a generation.
<br><br>
I was amazed at how much class plays a role in the climate crisis as well. The smoking analogy included the detail that if only one in eight people smoked, the whole world’s children would suffer the consequences (as is the reality of the climate crisis). The fact that the richest half of the world contributed 95% of the problem is infuriating, and helped me to see the need for climate justice.

The fact that CO2 has risen the most in a single life doesn’t surprise me. As technology improved it would be expected that CO2 would rise. Many new technology and other new developments are the main factors of CO2. What does surprise me is that people still choose to do nothing about it. We may not have known in the beginning the outcome that releasing a ton of CO2 would have but as we became informed, you would expect people to change their ways. That hasn’t happened and that makes me believe that it will be very hard to get people to change their daily activities. Like said in the video, the time delay is what’s leaving my generation to fix the Earth. You would expect people to care about what would happen to their family’s future but people are so adamant about not changing that they have doomed the Earth and left it to others to clean up but those others are their children and grandchildren.
<br><br>
 I’m really realizing as a citizen of the U.S. you can not blame the rising population as a main factor of climate change. There are around 327 million people in the United States and we contribute to a quarter of CO2 being released while there are 3 billion people who have only released 5% of CO2 into the air. These billions of people may not have access to things that release carbon as well in the US, but it shows that the US could drastically change the amount of CO2 we release into the air. We do not need to be the reason are Earth is destroyed.

At the beginning of the lecture, Hiltner proposed that the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime. He claims that the people that caused the problem are still alive and continuing to worsen the situation. He talked about how the release of huge amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, at the beginning, caused little impact which made it seem as not a big deal as people should have thought. Hiltner made it very clear about a “delay”. He stated that if we emitted enough CO2 into the atmosphere, which we did, there’d be a significant time delay before the consequences were to take effect. The delay played a major role in the climate crisis, because without it, we wouldn’t have gotten this far (i.e., we wouldn’t have let things like climate change get so out of hand. One thing that Hiltner said that sounded impactful was that, “During a single lifetime people enjoy, dozens of subsequent generations suffer”. Hiltner says the reason he said that the climate crisis came about in a single lifetime was because in 1959, the year he was born, was when it relatively started. He said that in his lifetime, that the concentration of CO2 had risen by 100 parts per million. He claimed that it would be higher if it weren’t for our oceans, which have absorbed a quarter of all the CO2 we’ve emitted. Hiltner apologies for his generation for all the damage they have caused. I feel that he shouldn’t have apologized for what his generation did, because it wasn’t his fault. And he shouldn’t feel ashamed about himself or his generation, because we’re all only humans, humans that make mistakes. This is why we learn from our mistakes, and why we are now working on fixing those mistakes.

<p>
I personally think that two of the largest climate justice issues we see today are two major ones discussed in this lecture: inter-generational climate justice and socioeconomic inequality. The fact that what we may consider the “western world” of Europe and North America have contributed 2/3 of CO2 emissions in the last 60 years, while the poorest 3 billion people have only emitted 5%, is one that our generation especially is going to have to address. People without that socioeconomic mobility aren’t as easily able to adapt to stronger, more sever weather events, droughts, fires, rising sea levels, etc, as those who can afford to do so, especially in the developed world. Furthermore, I think it is really important and understandable that our generation is highly concerned about climate and environmental issues as a whole, because we have inherited a planet that has not been looked at with long term sustainability in mind. If ¾ of all CO2 emitted has been released in the last 60 years, well within the previous generations’ lifetime, how are we to not be upset that that era of prosperity will inevitably lead to multiple generations of climate issues?

The grand scheme of it al seems to be that this whole crisis is distributed unevenly and unfairly. How can 1 eight of the people decide over the living conditions of the others. And that statement is only taking in consideration people and not even wildlife and nature as it is. It seems that we as human beings have a tendency to be extremely bad in realising long term consequences and are not so keen to act according to these consequences. You find this tendency in everyday situations and in big structures like politics. Nobody wants to think long term because that is not what the voters want to hear.The time delay illustrates perfectly why it was almost inevitable that this crisis would happen. All we can do now is try and take a moment to realise what is happening and then get right to action.

Unfortunately, the damage is done and the irresistible urge to capitalize on the opportunity for wealth through fossil fuels was impossible to avoid. The detachment from other regions of the planet is that is required to relieve the guilt that should be felt. However, mankind is not done. While certainly not exhaustive in verification of the source, Vox claims that Google, Amazon, and Microsoft see that there is no harm in being apart of the fossil fuel industry as their AI and technology is to be used, if not already being used, to locate and optimally extract deposits. It seems mankind's decadence is irredeemably destructive. Our only hope is that they know something we don't. I only hope that the wildfires in California, sea level rise, Australia's current wildfire, etc. are all just a fantasy. Learning more about the subject makes my head spin.

After looking at the climate crisis from a single generation perspective, it is crazy and saddening to see how much damage to our planet can be done by a single generation in less than a lifetime. Let alone the fact that much of this damage was brought about by a small group of our planets in habitants which will not have take the consequences of it problems. Those who will reek the consequences of this climate crisis will ultimately be the ones who were never involved in the creation of the crisis in the first place. This insight on a single lifetimes impact says a-lot about the costs of industrialization and determination to become superior by a few top countries, no matter what the costs ultimately are. Furthermore, what is trouble to myself and much of my generation is how this generation that has created the problem in the first place is still alive and is still determined to nor believe in the crisis they have caused. President Trump's abandoning of the Paris Agreement is only a scratch on the surface to his parties denial of the issue. Many still refuse to believe the crisis and turn their heads to the issue all together. What is mind blowing the most, is the fact that despite the warnings and indisputable evidence people still believe this issue is true, but do not change their ways of living to help with the crisis. I believe this is at fault to the generation that has created this issue and now has gone on to raise children on the same values they have lived their entire life on. Despite how alarming and serious this issue is I still find hope in the fact that this issue was brought about by one lifetime, meaning hopefully a new generation of young people can come together and stop this issue from getting worse in just one lifetime as well.

This lecture talked about how the crisis was largely brought about by a different generation.  Even worse, we know that generation did nothing to help prevent climate change when it was most preventable.  Even worse, that generation is still in power, which severely limits what my generation is able to do to combat climate change.   Even worse, that generation deliberately denies climate change all so that they can profit off of the coal industry.  They do this knowing they will never suffer the consequences as they will be dead.  This makes me mad and is why we are reduced to strikes and protests, which Ken shows in the first lecture.  We would love to do more, but are currently not able to.   

<br><br>
I also find it funny (not in a good way) how the U.S. makes up almost a quarter of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.  As has been said over the years, "You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain".  We have always thought of the U.S. as a hero and rightfully so.  We have stopped dictators, provided humanitarian aid, and were founded on the principal belief that all are created equal.  I would even argue that now, the U.S. is still an undeniable hero.  The problem is that our leaders and politicians who are preventing us from mitigating climate change are making us into something of a villain.  When 4% of the world's population is responsible for 25% of the emissions and is affecting over 50% of the world's population who have no choice but to suffer, that is not what a hero would do.  Nor are we the only country that causes a disproportionate amount of pollution.  But if we were to set an example and start mitigating (not even eliminating, just lessening the impact of) our contribution to climate change, that would set an example for the rest of the world to follow and prove that America is committed to helping fix a worldwide problem that we largely caused.  Other countries have done so, including many European nations.  So what is stopping us?

I would like to respond to Kevin because his response was exactly what I was thinking while watching the lecture video. When Professor Hiltner said that the person that created the climate crisis is still alive today, that spoke to me. I knew the problem was recent but not that recent. The fact that it’s the same generation who created the problem that are halting the plans for improvement is disappointing. It also feels like there is nothing the world can do about it. It feels that way but we know it is not entirely true! Kevin’s description of the U.S. being a villain as opposed to a hero was extremely refreshing. Through actually the reading, the film, and the lectures, it is extremely clear that the U.S is pretty much a horrible monster!
<br><br>
Another refreshing way to present the climate crisis came from the lecture. Professor Hiltner’s analogy of smoking and cigarettes and climate change was super easy to comprehend. The lasting effects of both horrors are permanent and significant. The CO2 emissions have increased by 100 since Kiltner was born. Honestly, what does that mean for my children and my grandchildren? I literally have no clue and when the professor keeps calling the earth uninhabitable it is very concerning. With a president that thinks the issue is fake and nonexistent it doesn’t look like any change will me made soon. On top of that everyone that votes on legislation that would make positive changes is the generation that caused the problem in the first place. This week’s assignment makes me feel as though we are doomed.

Climate change is the most important issue in our generation and is happening right now. Because of human activities, the environment on our planet is becoming worse and worse. It is true that if we still do not make any change, our future generation will be impacted badly.
<br><br>
Living standard of citizens in the United States is one of the highest in the world. Even though the population is not that large, the emission of greenhouse gases contributes a quarter of the world’s total emission. However, three billion people living in poor areas only emit five percent greenhouse gases. We are enjoying our life with happiness, but at the same time, others are suffered from no electricity or other resources. Thus, we have to change our life styles to save our Earth and to make others’ life better.
<br><br>
In the video, you also mention cigarette smoking. The analogy plays an important role here. People always stop smoking after they get a cancer or notice the bad effects of smoking. Just like smoking, after we notice that there are more and more extreme weathers nowadays, we know that the climate change is definitely happening. However, from my perspective, it is never late to make a difference from now on as long as everyone is willing to take an action in daily lives and be aware of climate change.

<p>
For the second lecture, "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime", I have always known that many of the first world countries have created very large amounts of pollution compared to the third world countries. But once actually seeing how 2/3rds of pollution is created by nations we look up to as leaders is honestly devastating. This also got me to think and ask myself, "Is this not ironic and hypocritical? That the people we look up to--celebrities, politicians, and industries--have all screamed for change and yet many of them contribute to the problem?" We are in a nation that has been a symbol of needing to fight for what is right, we have leaders that we put in office within our nation that have emphasize the need for change, we have important figures that have screamed that the time to act is now. Yet that percentage of 40% coming from my country says differently, and it is saddening that the hypocrisy is there within the land that is built on the ideology to fight for what's right.
<br><br>
For the first lecture, "The climate crisis as a generational issue", it was refreshing to actually witness students from UCSB participate in this issue. Though it is sad to see how our generation has to deal with the growing and and dangerous problem, to see the hundreds of students march on and know that this is an important matter makes me realize that our generation knows the problem. It also made me realize that many of us are taking responsibility in this matter, no matter what generation you are from. This is all our problem now, we can point fingers and blame people on who caused what, but the serious matter at hand is that we all need to cooperate now to make any change possible.

I agree with your statement that It is refreshing to see UCS students respond to this and act on this issue through protests. Protesting and speaking out about these issues is very important, thought it is important to note that our protests are self-contained. There are other places in-which the climate crisis is less understood, and I am left wondering how we can spread awareness about the problem to make a stronger impact on the problem. If the problem is politicians, how can we change public opinion and corporate interests?

Professor Hiltner’s video “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” highlights how the climate crisis is worsening at an alarming rate. Time delay is offered as an explanation as to why humans have not taken direct and immediate action to deal with the climate crisis. I thought Hiltner was absolutely right because I can understand how it feels to ignore the climate crisis for my own convenience. There are times where I could have carpooled or took public transportation, but, as I thought about it at the moment, I settled with the more convenient method of driving myself. These actions seem so minuscule in the moment when we do not stop to think about the consequences of our actions. Since we do not feel the effects immediately, everything seems fine and we continue to contribute to the climate crisis. 
<br><br>
I thought the analogy between smoking and the climate crisis was coherent and very well illustrated for me to understand the impact of climate change. Just like how smoking will impact future generations, climate change is caused by the previous generation without any input from the future one. Those who are born into this world amidst all wildfires, droughts, floods, and war did not choose to treat their planet the same way as the current and past generations. Therefore, I believe that it is incredibly unjust for the current generation of people to stand back and allow the climate crisis to continue. I cannot imagine seeing my children grow up in a world where they can no longer go outside because the air is hazardous to their health or are forced to relocate from their home because of flash floods. The human race as a whole must work together and not push away the responsibilities we have for the future generation of our race. Without action now, there will be no human race to carry on everything that we enjoy now. 
<br><br>
 Although the climate crisis has only been brought about in a single lifetime, we cannot let it continue to the next generation. A single lifetime has already led to the rise of carbon in the atmosphere from 315 ppm to 415ppm. At this rate, we are already suffering the consequences of the climate crisis. Wildfires in California and Australia, destructive hurricanes in tropical regions, and the melting of the arctic are just a few that are kicking off the spiral down into our own demise. At this point, we must take a radical step towards making changes to protect our environment. However, in order to make this a reality, we must have every single individual do the best they can to fight against the climate crisis.

similar to your perspective on the issue, "The Climate Crisis as a generational issue" and "How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime" helped me gain a greater understanding of the mentality that previous generations have had on the Earth as well as how our lifestyle and mentality will shape the future for those that follow us.  I also agreed with the argument that humans often neglect the environment because it may be easier or more convenient to do so. I liked your example of carpooling and public transportation because I think that it is an even more relatable example for our current generation. For the majority of us, driving represents a sense of freedom. To go where we want when we want. But our society has never truly considered the consequences of this mindset. If everyone were to drive their cars everywhere, it may be more convenient but it is far worse for the environment. 
<br><br>
Like the smoking analogy, I think your example does an exemplary job of demonstrating the idea of risk vs. reward when it comes to our actions in this climate crisis. For most of the population, the reward of greater accessibility and freedom outweighs the risk and potential consequences of their actions. Because we haven’t truly felt the ramifications of the Climate Crisis today, our society has made no real action to change their ways. While the risks of our current lifestyle may outweigh the rewards, society has no real way of knowing until it is too late. 
<br><br>
Lastly, I also appreciated your addressing the climate crisis as a generational issue. I felt that your examples of how our current lifestyle has affected the world around us were creative and your examples of the possible future consequences helped me gain a better understanding of what our future could look like. I feel that by including examples like this, or the footage that Professor Hiltner included, the Climate Crisis becomes much more real. I gain a better understanding of the conflict when faced with the immediate consequences of these actions. I think that if society as a whole emphasized the consequences of our lifestyle more, then it would be easier for policies and changes to be enacted to help combat the Climate Crisis.
<br><br><hr><br>
I completely agree that if "society as a whole emphasized the consequences of our lifestyle more, then it would be easier for policies and changes to be enacted to help combat the Climate Crisis. Before the first week of the winter quarter, the climate crisis did not seem that real to me because of how carefree and disconnected my life was. However, I agree that the footage and our professor does a great job of making the climate crisis feel much more personal. Sadly, I believe that the biggest problem is that people believe that they have no power individually to make a difference. It is easy to shrug the issue off and believe that one simple act won't stop the world from warming up if no one else is trying to make a difference. I view this issue as a catch-22 because if we believe that our individual actions can't help because other people are not acting then other people will not act because we are not acting ourselves. The result is that no one takes immediate action to resolve the issue of the climate crisis. Thanks to this class so far, I have also been able to feel and see the reality of the climate crisis and "gained a better understanding of the conflict when faced with immediate consequences of these actions."

The video “The climate crisis as a generational issue,” focused on how our current climate issues have been really addressed by the younger generations because it has gotten so bad we cannot ignore it anymore. It is clear that the main people really fighting for change are millennials and Gen Z’s, but not because we are more educated than those generations before us, but because we are unable to turn a blind eye and pretend nothing bad will happen anymore. Australia is on fire, earlier the Amazon was on fire, and around the world we have been seeing CO2 levels rise along with harsher natural disasters because of climate change. In his second video “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” addresses how our current climate crisis has been a long-awaited result of actions of humans now and generations before us. The fact that there is a time delay between releasing CO2 and the effects of CO2 means that older generations are more likely to think the current climate crisis is overdramatic because to them they think that all of the sudden all of these issues sprung up, when in reality this has been known and we have been expecting this to happen. This is an issue we should’ve been addressing but instead we’ve ignored it for our own convinces because we have been raised to rely on the simple things in life like single use plastics and driving everywhere. I love Hiltner’s cigarette example showing how our selfish actions hurt our planet, yet we continue to ignore the issues around us.
</p><hr>


<p>
We preach about social equality, yet the cars we drive contribute to rising levels of CO2 in our atmosphere that is making the earth warm up, the ice melt, and civilizations sink. We wear clothes that were made in developing countries, by people who are paid less than a dollar a day, just to keep up with the latest trends, and throw our clothes away once we don’t feel like wearing them anymore. We eat cattle, that contributes to the depletion of land, and an excess of methane in the air.
<br><br>

 All these aspects are of our everyday lives that are contributing to a massive amount of CO2 in the air, melting icebergs, and contributing to rising sea levels. We do these things because we do not see the true cost of climate change. We will never understand what it is like to be relocated as a result of rising sea levels, we will never know what it's like to have our primary source of food be endangered, we will never know what it’s like for our children to starve because we can’t afford the high cost of food! We are not changing, because we can’t see the direct effects of climate change. I believe the biggest issue in climate change is people's ability to turn a blind eye to the issues we do not experience. We are passing off a mess that we cause to the world’s poor to clean up and suffer with the consequences. I am also ashamed of the world that I have inherited, and of my own carbon footprint.

Ken suggested that his proposition to help stop climate change was radical, however, radical changes are necessary for the barbaric actions that got us into this mess. I attempt to not get morbid when talking about climate change, because I think it scares people, and makes them think that nothing can truly be done to fix the mess we’ve gotten into. But climate change is terrifying, and the fact that the U.S. has not taken the necessary steps to combat climate change makes it even more terrifying. We have the technology and resources to change the course that we are taking, yet we are still living the same carbon addicted lifestyles. Climate change skeptics will argue that climate change is natural, and that the Earth goes through fluctuations of global warming and cooling because of the Earth’s natural tilt, but they forget to mention, that the last time a major global warming event happened, humans were not around, and can certainly not survive a major extinction event! Why do we have to wait for our climates to turn catastrophic to change, when we still have a chance to salvage a future for our planet. We are close to reaching a tipping point, where we will be unable to act at all, so in the meantime, we should be doing as much as we can to reduce our carbon emissions.

The global climate crisis is happening at a very fast pace, according to professor Hiltner that the climate issues are worsened so much even within one generation. It was after industrialization that humans began to emit a massive amount of Carbon dioxide into the atmosphere along with many greenhouse gases. Although the time since our destruction to the environment is fairly short, the consequences are profound and serious enough to threaten the nature of our planet earth. I was shocked that the effect (especially the sudden temperature rise) has been brought about in such a short time (some 100 years) comparing with the planet’s natural temperature rise which took millions of year to be done. Our activities are destructing the earth’s natural cycle of life.
<br><br>
Another thing that I must address in this comment is the “delay” in the actual effect of post-industrialization massive carbon emission. Professor Hiltner uses the analogies of pouring a drop of oil into the well together with the consequences of smoking to address the seriousness of the problem. For decades humans have little to no caution about the consequences of our greenhouse gas emission into the atmosphere, however, the impact that human activities had on the planet would be accumulative and it takes time to reveal how bad they actually are. I blame myself to be a person whose lifestyle is threatening the earth environment and our very survival. And now I eventually have the chance to look back at my 20 years of existence on earth worrying about how much contribution could my very existence did on global warming. It arouses such as subtle feelings; it is so profound that I sometimes feel pessimistic about the human race. Yet I understand that our generation or the offsprings of us would suffer the most from the many consequences of global warming and climate crisis. Urgent changes would be needed to change the current situation, and it is our responsibility to reduce the harm of human activities on the earth and hopefully could save ourselves.

The climate crisis has been around for a long time and as Professor Ken Hiltner  states, it is a generational issue. Younger generations are starting to realize the severity of older generations actions and are trying to put a stop to it through protests and activism. However, often times young people are shut out by politicians and adults stating that they're young and naive and have no idea what they're talking about. People's delayed reaction is due to them not seeing the damage that is currently going on because of the lack of coverage and awareness. Politicians aren't exactly helping with climate change as they profit from corporations emitting CO2 into the Earth and refuse to acknowledge people's actions as a cause to the Earth's demise. Something disappointing that I learned from this video is the United States inability to take responsibly for the damage they along with other developed countries have had on planet Earth. Instead we hear how they put the blame on other countries who have higher populations yet the U.S. alone accounts for one quarter of the CO2 in the air due to Americans lavish lifestyles and meat consumption.
</p><hr>




<p>
You did a good job of breaking it down. The climate change idea was a rapid idea developed by the findings of the damage caused to our planet. This includes the vast pollution of air, light, and waste. Despite these factors, the intentions of people are what made the climate crisis inevitable. Because there was inaction in our process of environmental protection, there was room for the atmosphere to keep getting polluted.

Something I find fairly apropos of the climate crisis is that the single generation that caused it lived in a manner that had never been seen before in human history. (I'd like to preface this comment by saying that I am writing from a perspective of privilege as an affluent U.S. citizen. When I write "we" or "us". I'm generally referring to other similarly privileged people.)
<br><br>
Prior to the consumer culture of the 1950s, the majority of Americans led simple and fairly modest lives. They were thrifty, crafty, and lived with what they had. Our living spaces were smaller. We had smaller wardrobes prior to the advent of fast fashion. We wasted less of what we bought: from food to aluminum foil to thread to yes, fossil fuels like gasoline and natural gas, people generally knew to "use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without!" Even further back, prior to the Industrial Revolution and the subsequent mass migration to factory jobs, we generally led lives of consumption for subsistence only. If we kept the same philosophy when discovering fossil fuels, I think that we would not be facing as dire of a situation now.
<br><br>
One argument common in addressing the climate crisis is that we'll need a radical lifestyle overhaul in Western, "advanced" civilizations, as Ken alluded to in this video lecture. We'll need to wean off fossil fuels and learn to be content with less: a smaller home, a smaller family, a plant-based diet. Looking at cultures and nations who model aspects of this modest lifestyle, as well as prior generations who seemed happy with less, I think that the modern American idea of success and happiness was yet another poisonous gift from the boomer generation, along with the climate crisis. The idea that we will be satisfied with more or that we should keep using as much as we please without regards to the harm it causes to others is toxic and unnatural, and incredibly recent in human history as well. 
<br><br>
As enraging and disheartening as the truth about the generational origin of the climate crisis can be, we can take away the idea that a wide-sweeping, radical lifestyle change can alter the fate of the planet for many generations to come. As educated, affluent people, especially those of us who live in the U.S., it is up to us to band together across divides like age and use our collective power to drive positive change in the face of the climate crisis. Even though my generation is not at fault for climate change, and individuals like Ken from previous generations agree with those of us who are angry, by now it is obvious that it is up to us to act if we want to make any difference in climate change projections at all.
</p><hr>


<p>
Many fellow students concentrate on the astonishing inequality of consumption and suffering. I have to admit that I am indeed influenced and feel sorry for those in poor countries. However, I am thinking about something more. According to Fermi’s paradox, there is a possibility that we cannot find any extraterrestrial life is that life will not be prosperous  forever and civilizations stay for a relatively short period. I tend to look into the fact that what every form of life, including human beings, is like basically. We are selfish, we vary in development, and we follow relatively similar patterns of development. The problem is, this pattern has not and will have no negative derivative, because since the most advanced group has a dominant power, they can dispose of their waste of development at will and therefore there is no motivation for their further development, and therefore they will stay at the wasting level forever. Since such a group has no idea about how to efficiently produce (environmentally), there is no clue that these relatively undeveloped groups will learn the technology and develop with relatively fewer cost. After all, their major concentration is to become more advanced. (Their power can prevent themselves from being harmed and its privilege generally outweighs its climate destruction to its own country.) Therefore, the only way to stop increasing pollution is to reach a time that universally a sense is obtained that the Earth is harmed too much. However, will the universal agreement really happen? Not really since undeveloped still seek to grow faster and developed can still find a place to pump their waste. The past has proved that our foreseen ability is relatively weak.

This lecture video did a great job at allowing the viewer to better understand the build up of the climate crisis we find ourselves in and how crucial it is for this generation to begin making a change. Older generations are blamed for their burning of fossil fuels and emitting massive amounts of carbon dioxide, which led to newer generations following in their footsteps. Climate change has become a problem because we continue to ignore the obvious problem it has become and simply hope some one fixes it, but it is time we realize we have to be that "someone" who begins to make a change before it is too late. The fact that the developed countries are the ones responsible for two thirds of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere yet the poorest countries which have contributed much less are the ones who will be mostly affected is absolutely unfair. It is selfish of us to ignore the climate crisis simply because we wont see as much of the consequences yet those have not contributed to this problem at the scale we have will suffer , that should be reason enough to want to make a change. The past generation might us left us with a planet on its way to becoming uninhabitable; however, that doesn't not mean our generation simply has to accept that future. We as a more educated generation regarding this issue should work on bettering not only our future but that of future generations.

It’s unsettling thinking about humanity’s influence in this world within the span of one
person’s lifetime. Through wars, imperialism, and genocide, we’ve caused a
great deal of destruction to not only ourselves but the environment. It is only
right that our next fight is against nature itself. Although we are technically
fighting ourselves since we have been the cause of climate change for decades,
we will feel the ripple effects in the form of extreme weather and major
losses. Ken’s analogy between smoking cigarettes and CO2 pollution really
opened my eyes to the way our consumer culture deals with our problems. In our
developed day and age, we can no longer recycle everything, but rather dispose our
waste as we indirectly suffocate the lives of innocent people. The United
States alone has put ¼ of the total CO2 into the atmosphere. It hurts to feel
helpless in a world created by older generations who discounted the
consequences of their futures and their children’s futures. As convenience and
luxury envelop our livelihood, we must always be aware of the repercussions for
they will not go unnoticed.

Professor Hiltner’s lecture, “The climate crisis as a generational issue” mainly talks about how his generation has deeply influenced the climate crisis we are living in today. By appealing the emotion , the professor alarms nowadays people that current damage to the earth such as the release of CO2 will have serious impact on our children and all generation in later few hundred years. Therefore, what we all should do is to protect our planet in order that later generation could live better.
</p><hr>


<p>
We see that the climate change is brought upon by the rapid development of countries. As these technologies bring us prosperity, our failure to see the possible consequences of such overuse of fossil fuels has brought us to this point. I think it is not a time to blame, but reflect on how easy it is to do damage than it is to reverse it. Of course many corporations from the last century still rely on these primary energy sources nowadays and they don’t want to lose on the profit because of climate change, but there are many people across the generations realizing the crisis and trying to push for reform. Of course there was little action in the past decade, but as the knowledge spreads, the public will act and make it before the ultimate catastrophe.
</p><hr>

<p>

I found a hilarious thing is that the current climate change, temperature rise are not caused in hundreds of years. Instead, it is happened in decades, in a lifetime. That is, the people who cause this problem is still alive, and most of them don't realize the severity of this problem, and they are still making the situation worse. I just don't understand why these people are doing this. Without an inhabitable place for human to live, even with unlimited wealth, we cannot survive, not to mention to have places and time to spend them. We should take sustainable development, not destructive development. Also, the amount of CO2 has increased tons of millions in just recent years. If we do not take serious action to slow the rate of emitting greenhouse gases, our Earth's temperature will increase more rapidly than ever before, and the low elevation country, or the coastal cities, will be invaded or submerged by sea.
</p><hr>


<p>
I knew that the climate crisis had been mostly caused in recent decades, but I had no idea that it was to the extent it is. The idea of the significant delay that Professor Hiltner explains helps to frame how what is currently happening could be possible. What really jumped out at me when watching this video was the gross damage one generation of people from a small portion of the world has done. The fact that the CO2 in the atmosphere has grown from 315ppm to 415ppm in only 60 years is ridiculous and insane. The fact that the U.S., Europe, and Russia are responsible for ⅔ of the CO2 emitted when they only make up ⅛ of the world’s population just makes the situation look much worse. Parallel to the trend, the climate crisis is unfairly affecting the poorest people in the world way more than it is affecting the people who actually caused it.
</p><hr>


<p>
Ken’s generation may have caused this but our generation continues to make it worse as well; we obsess over material items that are not sustainable (items that will not decompose for thousands of years) only because it looks good and is only slightly more convenient in that it has no wires. This makes me so mad because it is so hypocritical to our generation, the ones who are supposed to enact change would rather spend money on items that are not recyclable or sustainable for aesthetic purposes. But for me, this introductory lecture was very enlightening as just an introduction. The smoking metaphor was a really great way to compare how climate change started and evolved into something terrible for us humans in the long run. Also, the statistic of increasing 100 PPM in a span of sixty years is so shocking to me. Even during the lecture, Ken explained that we increased more PPM than ever before in a sixty-year period. We go through so much which in turn creates more emissions-- basically our new norm now and others suffer because of us.

Important ideas I learned from the lecture videos are how climate change is a snowballing effect, it is not something that just happened, but had been building up by the past generations for at least a few decades. What puts fear in me is that the disasters we’ve seen are just the beginning, things are going to be much more scary, and more specieses are going to suffer. One good thing is that if actions and attention is taken immediately, we could prevent the situation from becoming worse, but the downside is also obvious, we are running out of time. Once we go past the turning point, there’s no way back. 
<br><br>
Like many of our classmates, I have hope that our generation is strong enough to take this responsibility. Looking back at the mistakes we had made does not do anything and certainly won’t make things better.

I am with you when it comes to worrying about what kind of disasters we will face as a species once our planet begins to reach too high of temperatures. As you said the people of this generation must be the ones to make a change. I believe this will be done by improving our technology and continuing to focus on eco-friendly solutions.

<br><br><hr><br>
I agree with your idea that this is rather a snowballing effect; something that started off small and is now becoming something extremely serious. I also agree with your statement that “we are running out of time” and we need to make effective decisions now. I think a great challenge to the United States is that climate deniers and many Americans are able to ignore the impacts of climate change because they haven’t been personally impacted by the severity of this climate crisis. Additionally, as suggested by Professor Hiltner, developing countries such as the United States, are able to live life without making environmental changes because they are not personally impacted by the consequences. However, these consequences are becoming too severe to ignore and extreme weather storms have been causing great harm to our country, such as the wildfires on the California and the hurricanes on the East Coast. I agree with you that proper action needs to be taken now or we will face more consequences and more suffering.

The first lecture did an excellent job of explaining how climate change is a generational issue handed to us by our parents' generation. It address how the youth of today will be severely impacted by the previous generation's lack of care in regards to climate issues. Although they are without a doubt responsible for today's global climate, one must realize that the effects of their impact have not been felt, on a personal scale that is, until fairly recently. Of course, global ice caps have been melting but because it was a problem so far removed from everyday life people were able to ignore it. Their true failure came in the form of their lack of action after the problem had been voiced. Politicians and large corporations have immediate individual, monetary interests and couldn't care less about the future because they will be long gone by the time the disastrous effects of global warming come to light. 
<br><br>
The second lecture went into depth about how the issue of climate change has been generational, and also provides interesting facts about worldwide CO2 footprints. The US for example has one of the largest footprints in the world despite having 3% of the world population. This goes to show that climate change is a problem bought about by the rich but will directly affect the poor. Poorer countries with their weaker infrastructure and less developed cities and transportation methods will be the first to feel the effects of climate change on a life changing scale. It is therefore up to the incoming generation to adopt teaching methods to educate those who don't know about the severity of this issue as well as implement this information into schools at a young age so the generation after us will be well equipped to pick up where we left off in the fight for humanity's survival.

I completely agree with your statements on climate change. As Ken mentioned, the time delay is one cause of our planet being in the state that it is now. I would like to imagine that if the present-day effects were experienced sixty years ago, there would be a greater motivation to decrease our carbon footprints, where the carbon dioxide concentration was 315 ppm. I also agree that we are not always witnessing climate change in our daily lives. Like you said, the ice caps are out of sight and therefore, out of mind. That is true for species becoming extinct, ecosystems diminishing, and to an extent, increasing temperature. So, what do you think would be a way to get people to care? How do we allow people to feel connected to the climate change crisis when they (and sometimes I) feel so detached?

In Professor Hiltner’s first lecture video, he talks about the climate crisis as a generational problem started from his generation, and it was passed down to our generation. As opposed to Professor Hiltner apologizing for his generation’s lack of awareness and action, I believe that our generation also shares the responsibility. A lot of young people now recognize that the earth is becoming more and more inhabitable, but they simply have no motivation to do anything about it. Not because they grew up with parents who did not care or because they grew up with unsustainable lifestyles, but because they think that how the world is now is the most efficient, profitable, and convenient. In other words, they are afraid to change because they are too comfortable with how the earth is now. However, they don’t realize that the earth is slowly but surely starting to change, and when they start to want to change, it would already be too late.
<br><br>
People nowadays are preoccupied with analyzing statistics and the science behind climate change, but they fail to understand the root cause. Our society is built solely upon the exploitation of our habitat, and to us, damage to the environment = profit and success. I am excited to see what kind of solutions that Professor Hiltner proposes.
</p><hr>


<p>
Being a part of this younger generation, I find it hard to believe that people in the past generation, and even the ones in mine, are still doubting climate change. However, I can understand why. The climate delay, as mentioned in the lecture, is still affecting us today. We can go about our day without thinking about climate change once because we aren’t seeing the consequences directly, especially in developed nations. I think its really easy to turn a blind eye to climate change when our homes aren’t the ones being flooded and our lives aren’t being put at risk because of unforeseen natural disasters. Some of us don’t even mean to ignore the issue, it just happens. At times, I do find myself thinking about climate change and I wonder how different my life will be in a couple years or whether or not I’m going to choose to have children. As Ken mentioned at the end of the lecture, the solutions to the problem are going to be radical. On top of that, we have to act now. Just seeing the world is now makes me lose hope that we may have a chance of halting climate change. Huge fossil fuel companies are still being protected by politicians and contributing everyday to the problem. Sometimes I wonder that if people from a couple decades ago knew how bad climate change would get, would the outcome today be different? I would hope it would be better, but unfortunately it seems that money and status dominate our world.

Hiltner does an excellent job of describing the causes and impacts of climate change in a concise yet clear way.  The segment of the video that most stood out to me was the one about the progressively heightened fraction of CO2 PPM in our atmosphere. The fact that ¾ of the increase in CO2 PPM has occurred during the lifetime of Hiltner is alarming – and with the shown projection of CO2 PPM in the next twenty years it makes me question whether today’s society can actually change their practices before it is too late. Although Hiltner spends a good amount of the video saying that the previous generation of people (many of which who are still alive) is to blame for these climate changes, I believe it is a bit unfair to blame one generation as a whole. As Hiltner discusses, the time delay of climate was a major reason why people failed to see the true potential impact of the mass consumption of fossil fuels. As a result, it may have been difficult for monetarily prioritized company throughout the last generation to focus on cutting down this negative consumption when they did not see immediate impact. However, in the last 30 years, as the impact of this has been seen clearly, it is definitely up to both the previous and current generation to change our ways to help future generations.

<p>
In the video, “The climate crisis as a generational issue”, Ken showed us that the environment change is not a temporally caused issue, but caused by a long period of development. I really love ken’s illustration of future challenges and possible solutions for us to deal with them, so that we could save the earth. He made a really useful analogy that a person could smoke without any negative impact on their health and would smoke packs of cigarettes every day for their entire life, but still their children would suffer from those actions and show the severity of the bad outcomes if the past generation didn’t do the beneficial things then the following generations would have to deal with the great pressure posed by their ancestors. 
 <br><br>
Literally, the burning of fossils itself is not a horrible thing, because it ha started during the Shakespeare’s time. But 1/4 of the total CO2 are produced in the past 60 years. There is still another ironic thing in the video that the Europeans and Americans produced 2/3 of the total emissions.
<br><br>
While reading these 2 videos, I become so concerned for  my children and future generations. I consider how I can contribute on the climate crisis, think about practical ways for me to reduce carbon footprint. Hopefully, although it is unfair for older generation people to pollute the earth and make it worse, the bright thing is that more and more people are becoming more concerned about this issue.

</p><hr>


<p>
The video mentions that the United States emits a quarter of CO2 with 4% of the world's population, while the United States, Russia and Europe combined emit two-thirds of CO2, that means countries which are well developed need much energy and more productions. Like the example in the video--smoking, when people are smoking, they probably will not realize that may cause cancer and affect their children. People always focus on short-term benefits but ignore some long-term influences. People feel good when they are smoking even though they know it may cause cancer because they do not have cancer at that time. If one day those people really have cancer, they will start to regret. Same way, people continue to pollute because they know the pollution is the “by-product” of their real products. When people are enjoying their lives and releasing carbon dioxide, they are not aware that small pollution will be developed into a huge disaster.

In these lectures, Ken explains how climate change is the results of very recent history. The generations that precede ours have caused harm to the planet that my generation and those that follow must suffer through and attempt to fix. And, the wealth and power of the developed world, which was largely accumulated based on a destructive fossil fuel economy, will help protect us from the harm that much of the developed world has caused while those in developing countries will suffer the most. The injustice associated with this infuriates me because the most undeserving populations will have to pay for the selfish and destructive actions of powerful and wealthy people in the developed world. The fact that the people who helped contribute the most to climate change will see the least of the consequences is unfair to say the least, whether it's because they will die of old age before seeing the catastrophic effects, or because they didn't have the privilege of being born in a developed country. The fact that the people to be held accountable for this crisis are the same people with the power to impose aggressive climate action to curtail this crisis is very concerning to me, as it seems like there is no hope in solving this issue because said people profit from/gain power from the slow destruction of our world. For the world's sake, I hope I'm wrong about that.

This video highlights how ironic it is that the majority of the population above 50 years old value issues such as immigration control, border security and healthcare over converting our economy to entirely renewable energy or decreasing our annual carbon footprint tremendously. This is an ironic situation because the climate crisis is, in fact, a generational issue, as Lyndon Johnson, who’s presidency ended and started in the 1960s, was the first president to be notified that our rapidly increased carbon emissions were starting our atmospheic temperature to rise at a pace too fast to maintain sustainable environemnt for future generations. This was nearly sixty years ago. In the course of this time between then and present day, little has been done at a national level to cap the amount of carbon emissions each American puts into the atmosphere on a daily basis. No carbon tax has ever been passed, climate crisis science and awareness is not mandated to be taught in schools, and in some places still viewed as socialist and radical propoganda, and the most popularly purchased vehicles in America are SUVs and trucks which burn gasoline much faster than any other type of personal vehicle. This consumer mentality is something that has been developed in America since the industrial revolutuion, constantly racing towards technology that will allow us to have our food, clothes and transportation at our fingertips whenever we want it. It is astounding that as our parents and grandparents created a problem to be passed along to following generations, leaving us to tackle a monstrous problem, while the generation who created the problem predominantly control the Senate and the House of Representatives, and still are not urgently making governmental improvements for a sustainable country. Not only this, this generation is not actively attempting to change the luxuries they enjoy, since the traumatic effects of climate change will not be affecting the world in their lifetime, which only further reinforces the consumerist mindset my modeling this unsustainable way of life to younger memebers of their families, students and people they may mentor.

After the lecture video, it is surprising that poor countries are contributing the least to climate change, however, they are the ones that are being affected the most.  Why should the less fortunate suffer from the actions of the wealthy?  Also, Ken emphasized how different generations contributed to the carbon dioxide being put out into the atmosphere and how the generations after have to deal with the consequences that are made from actions they did not commit.  I notice that in my generation a lot more people are starting to educate themselves on this topic of sustainability to help fight against climate change, even some are trying to pursue a career in this because they really see a big issue and want to make a significant cause to change the world.  In the past, not that many were going into this field to help reduce climate change because many were not seeing the effects yet, but now climate change has become more of an issue and now receives more attention.  Most of the attention is coming from the new generation rather than the past generation because they do not want to take credit for committing climate change.  However, the whole generation is not in denial of the existence of climate change as displayed by Ken and also wants to help against what their generation has done to the planet.  This generation will be the ones to pull the planet out of climate change if it is possible before it is too late and the effects are too severe to be reversed.

Professor Hiltner's videos shed more light on the climate crisis.  I  found it interesting to see that he apologizes for his generation and their contribution to the drastic change of  Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere.  It is frightening to think about how much Carbon Dioxide has been released from 1959-2019.  The reality is that fossil fuels are still being released into the atmosphere and most people choose to ignore the issue.  It was upsetting to note that our country, the United States alongside Europe, and Russia have contributed to two-thirds of Carbon Dioxide released into the atmosphere.  The fact that Professor Hiltner goes on to say that the poorest 3 billion people in the world only contribute 5% to the issue is even more upsetting.  It goes to show how other people have to carry the burdens of richer countries.

</p><hr>


<p>
In the lecture “How the Climate Crisis was Brought About in a Single Lifetime”, Professor Hiltner states the reason why many people don’t think the climate crisis is a severe problem is that the consequences of climate change don’t show up immediately. Although these bad consequences of climate crisis won’t affect our lives too much, they will eventually affect our next generations. In order to make it easier for the audience to understand, professor Hiltner uses cigarette smoking as an analogy. Suppose you can indulge in cigarette smoking without any unhealthy consequences, but your children will suffer these consequences like cancer and heart disease. Will you continue smoking? In the same situation, would you want to hand in uninhabitable earth to your children and let them suffer all of the consequences that are caused by you? If you don’t want, stop producing more CO2 and take action to protect the environment. The professor also discusses environmental injustice which is the fact that some human groups suffer more risk of climate crisis than other people in society. According to the statistics, the United State which occupies 4% of the population produced a quarter of the CO2 in the atmosphere, and the poorest three billion people nearly half the population contribute only 5% of the CO2. However, poor countries suffer more from the climate crisis due to the lack of resources and technology. In the end, Professor Hiltner apologizes for what his generation has done to this planet. I think our generation should take this responsibility to fix our planet and try our best to leave a healthy planet for the next generation.

I think it's crazy how fast the growth rate is for the CO2 PPM in the atmosphere. How it escalated from the 200’s to the 300’s in a couple hundred years, then from the 300’s to the 400’s in a couple decades. Having the older generation apologize to the younger generations for teaching them to live a high CO2 output life is a step in the write direction. A lot of the younger generations are on board with climate change but don’t really have as much power in either companies or legislation to do as much about it. If the older generations in power were to accept that there is an issue, then action could be taken to bettering the environment. When I learned that the U.S. contributes 25% of the world CO2 i was shocked. A population so small creating majority of the problem. Then to learn that 66% comes from the western world makes you think about why this is. I guess it makes sense seeing how the steam engine and other similar inventions were created in the western world.

In my opinion this video, more than others you have posted previously takes a brutally honest reflection of the way our generation has treated and cared for this environment. It is embarrassing to admit, but everything you say is true in that we have, in one generation alone, caused more damage with carbon dioxide emissions than people who have lived for thousands of years before us have. Sadly, that isn't even the most embarrassing part of the story. The fact that this is PRIMARILY caused by the United States, which only comprises of only 4% of the world's population, is absolutely disgusting when we realize that the other, poorer countries around us have much larger populations and contribute to only 5% of carbon dioxide emissions. Unfair is the only word that comes to my mind when I think of these statistics. How much longer can we continue ruining our planet in such a greedy manner before we realize that residents of poor countries like Bangladesh will suffer first? 
<br><br>
You say sorry, but how was this in any of your control? I feel sorry too, but I don't really know what to do besides shifting my lifestyle to become more environmentally-minded. 
<br><br>
I guess what we are left to do is share what we are lucky enough to have been exposed by you because if maybe, one day, everyone realizes the truth, change will occur.

I agree with Hiltner’s comment on the delayed impact, and his example on smoking makes it more clear, that you might not see some major impacts now but it will appear in the future, we are leaving the younger generations behind us to suffer the consequences we made. In “The Uninhabitable Earth” it says that the reason that we don’t take climate changes seriously in our own environment is that we assume its effects will only impact elsewhere.  But after watching this video, we should all know that each one of us has the responsibility to put in actions to the environment around us and minimize the impacts.

After watching “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime”, it was difficult to understand exactly how much damage happened in such a short period. Ever since I can remember, climate change has been in my life. It is interesting and a little disheartening to believe that people could reasonably say that when they grew up they did not have to worry about climate change, instead they are the main factors behind the start of it. I really liked the metaphor with the smoker as it showed how unfair the situation with the environment is. Children who are born in the next coming years will inherit a sick world while those who harmed earth will continue to live in riches and abundance. Climate change is a generational issue but it won't stay that way.  If no actions are taken, this issue will spread to newer generations who are only cursed to be born in a world messed up by their ancestors. This video really opened up my eyes to the damage that fossil fuels have done to the environment in the last few decades. My generation has been fighting for what is right, to live in a world that is sustainable and habitable, something that the previous generations have taken for advantage. Activism from my generation is amazing, but at the end of the day the ones in power are still in an older state of mind and for them to truthfully start fighting climate change they must acknowledge that they are the ones at fault, something that doesn't seem very likely to happen anytime soon.

I agree with the point you brought up about how although our generation has been very vocal about change, the ones who can actually enact change are much older and don't see this situation in the same way we do. However, we must continue with our support of the planet if we wish to see any change. We may be lucky enough to actually see political change within the next couple of years and see change happening. Currently, we have the tools to fix the world and the science to know how to use them, it's just a matter of money to justify fixing Earth. I think that large oil companies would after see almost immediate directly negative effects of climate change to actually start taking the necessary steps to fix it.

“The climate crisis as a generational issue” and “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” talks about the point of how the past generation was the generation that was the major contributor to climate change and how now this generation is the one who basically has to deal with all the consequences of these actions that they made and are still making since most are still alive. Ken’s apology was very meaningful but at this point I think that while the past generation did cause the majority of the climate crisis this generation also seems to be following almost in similar ways, of course we are taking measures to better the world, but it seems as if the need for material things is also a major motivator in people's lives.
<br><br>
I definitely have a lot of hope in our generation and that we could slow down the effects of climate change but I can’t help but notice the same mistakes that past generations have done repeating themselves now. Hopefully we stop or find alternative ways to lessen carbon footprints and this generation is where most of expectations lie.

I agree that our generation seems to be following in the same footsteps as the past generation in regard to the various ways we mass produce CO2. The difference now is that we are bringing more attention to the situation because we see the amount of destruction that has been caused to the environment. I believe that this generation will make a great improvement on the huge carbon footprint we’ve left, sooner rather than later.
<br><br><hr><br>
I quite agree with what you said, just like in the video. We are not aware of the importance of climate change in time. And act in a timely manner. To change it involves many factors. Including political and commercial factors. The video also mentions those who contribute little to carbon dioxide emissions. But they have been harmed. Those who contribute more are not aware of the problem. This triggered my thinking. We should work together to overcome this problem. And realize the importance of this issue. The burning of fossil fuels does reduce the air quality a lot. For example, in Beijing, the capital of China, where I was born, the haze index is very high. Many people wear masks when they go out to avoid respiratory diseases. The weather has become very bad. I seldom see the blue sky. We really should act on climate change.
<br><br><hr><br>
The line "the climate crisis was caused in a single lifetime" stuck with me in particular, along with the fact that Russia, Europe, and the U.S. are responsible for roughly 2/3 of the carbon dioxide pollution in the atmosphere. While it would be easier to sit and be angry at the generations before us for perpetuating something that could have been prevented, I'm happy that our generation is directing energy and effort toward making change instead. Ken's apology eased a lot of tension I didn't know I had, frankly. I also agree with the fact that we are making the same mistakes that our predecessors did, whether it's through our diet or transportation, however I am more hopeful for the future after this particular video lecture. I believe that we have an extremely small window of time to turn things around and need to take this chance before the situation turns even more dire.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree completely with the take on the main perpetrators of the climate crisis being those from the past generation, but I feel that more importantly, those of my generation are the problem. People in our generation have seen the damage caused by those from past generations (especially the last one), yet still go on to make the same mistakes. I know that many people are uneducated on this issue and do not realize the magnitude of the effects their actions have to the increasing climate crisis, but many are aware and simply do not care or just make excuses. The cigarette smoking example that Ken portrayed in “How the climate crisis was brought about in a single lifetime” does a perfect job in demonstrating the way that a vast majority of us (especially in America) have little to no regard for the future of our planet and the species who inhabit it. 
<br><br>
 As many more people are becoming more aware of the downfall of our planet’s health, I somewhat disagree with your level of hope for this generation. Although I see that many more people are making changes to better the Earth and the climate crisis than in previous generations, I do not see enough people caring. As said in the video, ¼ of the CO2 in the atmosphere comes from the U.S., and I think the U.S. in this scenario can be easily compared to the individuals who are choosing to ignore this issue. The meat, palm, and fossil fuel industries along with many individually wealthy people are a huge source of the destruction, and although many others have changed for the better, without the cooperation of these few, I do not have hope of a large enough difference being made.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree with you and Ken by saying that the past generation is the one that it is in the most part responsible for the climate crisis as a whole and that the ones that are going to have to suffer the consequences are the current and future generations. However, I believe that there is no point in putting the blame on the past generation because it is something that is already going on, instead current generations have to work with the past generation in order to attempt and solve this problem. I think to begin we need to educate the past generation on the climate crisis as a vast majority do not believe in climate change and don't believe the crisis we are living through today is a real thing. 
<br><br>
Same as you I do have a lot of hope in our generation and in future generations as well. I believe that working together and taking the issue as seriously as it really is we can make a great change and save ourselves and our wonderful planet.
<br><br><hr><br>

I agree although the past generations inaction contributed to the state of the climate crisis, I think the younger generation although more involve are still kinda following the same path. Sure perhaps we try not to contribute too much waste or try to use reusable bottles, but we are not changing a major aspects of or lives, which is why we still are fine with how things are. If we were told to stop eating meat as much as you are used to, people would more likely to be in favor of supporting the cause because now it affects something from their daily lives. There has been lots of advocating for the climate crisis recently so I have hope that this generation will lead to changes that will help better the climate crisis at hand.
<br><br><hr><br>
I also agree that the generations before ours are the main cause for the world we live in today. Unfortunately A lot of the people of those generations still do not believe in climate change and still do not help our cause. Those people are also the ones who run our government which make things very difficult as no legislation is being passed to prevent companies from pumping more CO2 into our atmosphere. Ken's apology shows that there are some people who can accept their mistakes. The biggest issue is getting everyone to do so and not only accept them but to help fix what they did.
<br><br><hr><br>
You make a great point, I also agree that even though our past generation was the biggest contributor to the climate crisis  , people today are still following in thier footsteps. Our generation is more informed and are aware of the dangers that persist with greeenhouse gases which is why young adults like Greta Thunberg advocate for a healthier planet and a livable future for our future kids, but we need more human action. I understand it is difficult to change yor accustomed lifestyle and for the many people that are already contributing to a healthier earth it is amazing. As professor Ken mentioned it only takes 1/8 of the human population to make a huge difference to our earth, if we all were to emitt as few possible greenhouse gases as we can. In the past 60 years CO2 has risen by 100 points which if we keeping going the pace we are then in future years our children may experience harmful health issues. Hopefully we are the generation to stop this or at least lessen it.
<br><br><hr><br>
I totally agree with you. While millions of young generations are taking action in the streets and at the ballot, it still seems like a lot of people in the new generation are following down the same path the generations decades ago did. So many people are obsessed with having the latest and greatest thing and buying unnecessary things without thinking twice about the consequences that entail. Consumerism which was implemented into the old generations that are alive today has taught the new, younger generations to be consumerists.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree that the younger generation appears to be continuing the trend of the older generation, and I think it is kind of difficult to pin down to one specific generation when we look at this issue. However, I do agree that our generation seems to be more active in responding to climate crisis and raising awareness for the issue.

This video is particularly eye-opening to me because it included statistics that almost sound fake. The CO2 levels per million parts is increasing at a rate that seems unimaginably rapid, and we need to act on it. The scariest part of the whole climate change crisis is that people continue to deny the scientific facts they are presented with and it's unacceptable. Hearing the levels of pollution that Americans (who  only make up 4% of the earths population) have  done compared to the poorest billion people is honestly really hard to hear, since we all know we are contributing to this.  We see Ken apologizing to us, but when  will it be us apologizing to the generations to come?
<br><br>
The comparison to smoking cigarettes was an interesting perspective that I had never considered. They delay of effects of our actions truly will be the reason we succumb  to the climate crisis because people tend not to believe things without seeing the damages for themselves.

I really appreciate how Ken is addressing this subject as a generational issue, because it truly is. It can be so frustrating to see people who just don’t care about what is happening to our planet because they know they won’t be around to truly see the consequences. Myself and so many others are terrified, angry, and honestly devastated by the future we are inheriting. Myself and many others I know don’t even want to have children because we don’t want to bring them into a world that could be so dangerous to them in ways we have never experienced before. Our world is changing and we have no choice but to adapt as quickly as we can.
<br><br>
I also appreciated Ken’s apology for what his generation has done, but the sad part is that such a small proportion of his generation are the ones responsible. The devastating effects on our environment are on the hands of so few and the reality is that there is little the rest of us can do to truly make long lasting change. However, Ken mentioned his radical ideas to help us do just that, and I am in good company when I say I am more than ready to get radical.

I would like to add on to your last point about Ken's apology. I was happy to hear him apologize for his generation and I agree that effects are not necessarily on him. We should look at the people at the top and our government. Companies rely so much on fossil fuels and will even make the effort to mislead the public on climate change if it means they can make an extra buck.

After watching both lecture videos, it is apparent that the climate crisis is not only an environmental issue, but a human rights one as well. Beginning with earlier generations, the overwhelming majority of the damage has been selfishly done by a small fraction of the human population. By adopting a lifestyle built off the exploitation of fossil fuels, the actions of a few are detrimental to life as a whole. The disproportionate nature of the poorest 3 billion only contributing to 5% of carbon emissions is unjust on its own. However, the fact that they will also suffer the consequences of climate change the most is a product of the growing problem of global inequality. These populations are generally subject to environmental racism, live in at-risk areas for natural disasters, and face food scarcities and droughts as a result of the actions of the developed world. 
<br><br>
In addition to the current climate crisis stemming from wealthy and developed areas, it also originated in older generations that will likely not live long enough to experience the aftermath of their actions. As mentioned in “The climate crisis as a generational issue,” the delayed impacts of carbon emissions into the atmosphere is a driving force behind the younger generation’s fight against climate change. It is now our responsibility to reverse our dependency on fossil fuels and adopt more sustainable lifestyles to prevent future generations from having to suffer from an even larger accumulation of greenhouse emissions.

I did not know that one generation of people was largely responsible for the climate crisis, and only a small portion of them at that.
